Cognitive-Adaptive Governance: A Framework for the AI-Augmented Neural SolopreneurExecutive SummaryThe emergence of the "AI Creator"—a solopreneur leveraging generative artificial intelligence to produce output previously requiring entire teams—has created a unique operational paradox. While production capacity has expanded exponentially, the human cognitive capacity for executive function, prioritization, and attention management remains biologically finite. This divergence creates a governance crisis for the solo operator, particularly those navigating the neurocognitive landscape of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Traditional project management methodologies, such as Waterfall or rigid Scrum, presuppose organizational redundancy, linear attention spans, and external accountability structures that simply do not exist in a single-person enterprise.1This report presents a comprehensive, expert-level analysis of a Cognitive-Adaptive Governance System (CAGS) designed specifically for the AI-augmented solo creator. By synthesizing principles from Personal Kanban 1, "Agile for One" 4, Digital Gardening 5, and advanced Large Language Model (LLM) agent orchestration 6, this framework provides a minimalist yet robust operating system. The central thesis of this report is that effective governance for the solo creator is not about managing time, but about managing energy and cognitive load.7The proposed methodology utilizes a "Personal AI Life OS"—anchored in local-first, Markdown-based tools like Obsidian or Logseq—to externalize executive function. By structuring data with standardized YAML frontmatter 9, the creator enables AI agents to act as "Governance Copilots," automating backlog grooming, feasibility analysis, and strategic reviews. This report details the architectural, psychological, and operational components of this system, offering a path from chaotic ideation to high-signal, "evergreen" execution.1. The Neuro-Cognitive Landscape of the Solo CreatorThe foundational error in applying corporate project management tools to solo creative work is the assumption of neurotypical, continuous availability. For the solo creator—specifically one managing a "Personal AI Life OS" with limited capacity—the primary constraint is not hours in the day, but the availability of executive function. This section analyzes the specific cognitive hurdles facing the target demographic and establishes the psychological requirements for a functional governance system.1.1 The Solopreneur’s Dilemma: Infinite Ideation vs. Finite ExecutionThe modern AI creator operates in an environment of effectively zero marginal cost for idea generation. Generative AI tools allow for the rapid visualization of concepts, drafting of code, and outlining of content, leading to an explosion of the "Idea Backlog." However, the execution of these ideas—bringing them to a finalized, shippable state—still requires significant human oversight, decision-making, and "finishing energy".3This imbalance creates a bottleneck at the governance layer. In a traditional organization, the "Product" function (ideation) and "Engineering" function (execution) are separated by different teams and negotiated via roadmaps. For the solopreneur, these competing functions occupy the same neural real estate. The creator must simultaneously be the visionary CEO and the pragmatic laborer. Research into "Agile for One" methodologies indicates that this dual role leads to rapid context-switching fatigue, where the brain exhausts its glucose reserves merely toggling between "deciding what to do" and "doing the work".2Furthermore, the "Shiny Object Syndrome" (SOS) is not merely a behavioral quirk but a structural risk factor for solo businesses.10 Without the stabilizing inertia of a team or a rigid corporate roadmap, the solo creator is highly susceptible to the novelty bias. New ideas arrive with a dopaminergic premium—they feel exciting, urgent, and perfect—while existing projects, now in the "slog" phase of execution, feel draining. The governance system, therefore, must act as an artificial "inertia generator," slowing down the intake of new ideas to match the throughput of execution.121.2 The ADHD Executive Function GapFor creators with ADHD, the challenges of solo governance are amplified by deficits in executive function, specifically in working memory, prioritization, and time perception.131.2.1 Time Blindness and the "Now/Not Now" DichotomyADHD cognition is often characterized by "Time Blindness"—an inability to accurately sense the passage of time or predict how long tasks will take. The ADHD brain tends to categorize tasks into only two timeframes: "Now" and "Not Now".13Implication for Governance: Traditional Gantt charts and long-term milestones are often ineffective because they exist in the abstract "Not Now." A functional system must bring the relevant future into the visual "Now" (via boards and visual cues) while hiding the overwhelming bulk of the "Not Now" (the backlog).11.2.2 The Dopamine-Dependent WorkflowWhile neurotypical motivation can often be sustained by importance or obligation, ADHD motivation is primarily regulated by dopamine. This means the creator can hyperfocus intensely on tasks that provide intrinsic interest, novelty, challenge, or urgency, but experiences physical resistance—often described as the "Wall of Awful"—when attempting routine or boring tasks.14Implication for Governance: A prioritization matrix based solely on "Business Value" (e.g., ROI) will fail if the creator cannot psychologically engage with the work. The governance system must incorporate "Excitement" or "Dopamine" as a weighted variable in decision-making, acknowledging that a high-value task that never gets started has an effective value of zero.161.2.3 Working Memory DeficitsThe solo creator holds the entire state of their business in their head. For an ADHD individual with limited working memory, this is a recipe for "cognitive thrashing"—the anxiety that something important is being forgotten.Implication for Governance: The system must be a "Trusted External Brain." It must capture open loops instantly and reliably so the brain can let go of the need to actively remember them. This aligns with the "Getting Things Done" (GTD) principle of "Mind like Water," but requires digital tools that reduce the friction of capture to near zero.181.3 The "Agile for One" AdaptationStandard Agile methodologies like Scrum are designed for teams. They involve roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner) and ceremonies (Standups, Retrospectives) that provide social pressure and accountability. "Agile for One" strips away the social components but retains the empirical process control: Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation.20Table 1: Adapting Agile Principles for the Neurodivergent Solo CreatorStandard Agile PrincipleSolo Creator RealityGovernance AdaptationDaily Standup (Team Synch)No team to sync with; solitary work can lead to drift.Daily Self-Briefing: A 5-minute journal entry or AI chat to orient attention and identifying the single "Daily Highlight".4Sprint Planning (Consensus)High risk of overcommitting due to "optimism bias."Capacity-Based Planning: Using historical velocity (or pure item count) to limit commitments, specifically subtracting 40% of perceived capacity for "ADHD tax".7Retrospective (Process Improvement)Often skipped due to shame over missed goals.Compassionate Review: Focusing on "What worked?" rather than "Why didn't you finish?", using data to adjust future capacity rather than moralizing failure.8Definition of Done (Quality Assurance)Ambiguous; creator can endlessly tweak.Front-Loaded DoD: Defining strict, checkbox-based exit criteria before a task is moved to "Doing".221.4 The AI-Augmented OpportunityThe introduction of the "Personal AI Life OS" transforms the governance landscape. Previously, the solo creator had to be both the worker and the manager. Now, Large Language Models (LLMs) can assume the role of the manager. By structuring the project data in a way the AI can parse (Markdown/YAML), the creator can offload the heavy lifting of prioritization, grooming, and planning to an agent.6 This "AI Governance Layer" acts as a prosthetic executive function, providing the structure and accountability of a boss without the cost or friction of a human hire.232. Architectural Foundation: The Digital Garden as Governance HubTo support the cognitive needs outlined above, the governance system requires a robust, flexible, and AI-readable storage architecture. We reject rigid project management software (like Jira or Asana) in favor of a "Personal AI Life OS" built on local-first, Markdown-based tools like Obsidian or Logseq. This approach aligns with the "Digital Garden" philosophy, which treats projects not as static tasks but as evolving living entities.52.1 The "Digital Garden" Metaphor for Project LifecycleTraditional project management treats tasks as binary: "To Do" or "Done." The Digital Garden model introduces nuance that is psychologically safer for the ADHD mind, reducing the shame of unfinished work by reframing it.Seeds (The Inbox/Nursery): These are raw ideas, captured quickly. They have no obligation attached. They are not "tasks" yet; they are possibilities. They sit in the Nursery to see if they take root (sustain interest) or wither (lose relevance).5Saplings (Incubation/Sprouting): Ideas that have survived the initial filter. They are being fleshed out, researched, and structured, but are not yet in active execution.Trees (Active Projects): The few items currently receiving water (resources/time). These are the focus of the governance system.Evergreens (Knowledge Assets): Completed projects do not disappear; they become "Evergreen" notes—reusable assets, code snippets, or content that form the creator's long-term knowledge base.Compost (Archive): Ideas that were deprioritized. They are not "failures"; they are composted to provide nutrients (inspiration/context) for future ideas.This taxonomy is crucial because it decouples capture from commitment. The creator can capture 100 "Seeds" without the psychological weight of having 100 "Tasks" on their to-do list.252.2 The Technical Schema: Markdown and YAML FrontmatterFor an AI agent to govern this garden, the data must be structured. We utilize YAML Frontmatter at the top of every Markdown file. This serves as the "API" for the AI Life OS.6The schema must be standardized to allow agents to perform queries like "Show me all high-impact, high-dopamine projects that are currently stuck."Table 2: The Governance YAML SchemaFieldTypeAllowed ValuesGovernance PurposeAI Agent FunctiontypeStringseed, project, area, resource, journalCategorizes the file within the system.Allows AI to filter files for specific workflows (e.g., "Groom only seeds").statusStringincubating, ready, active, blocked, evergreen, compostDefines the lifecycle stage.Enables AI to enforce WIP limits (e.g., count status: active).tagsList[#dev, #content, #admin]Contextual linking.Facilitates "Intercropping" (batching similar tasks).priority_scoreNumber1-1000 (Calculated)derived from RICE/DICEUsed for automated sorting and suggestion of "Next Actions."energy_costInteger1 (Low) - 5 (High)Subjective estimate.Allows AI to suggest tasks based on user's current energy level.7dopamine_levelInteger1 (Boredom) - 5 (Hyperfocus)Subjective estimate.Critical for ADHD engagement; helps AI identify "slump busters."due_dateDateYYYY-MM-DDSoft or Hard deadlines.Triggers urgency warnings.dependenciesLinks[[Project A]]Blocking relationships.Prevents AI from suggesting blocked tasks.Example File: Project_Neural_Governance.mdYAML---

.92.3 Folder vs. Tag Structure (The Hybrid Model)While "link-based" organization (Zettelkasten) is popular, governance requires some rigid hierarchy to separate "Actionable" from "Reference."Recommended Directory Structure:00_Inbox (The Landing Zone for all new inputs)10_Governance (Dashboards, Decision Logs, Weekly Reviews)20_Garden21_Seeds (Backlog)22_Sprouting (Incubating/Planned)23_Trees (Active Projects - STRICT LIMIT)30_Areas (Ongoing maintenance: Finance, Health, Admin)40_Resources (Reference materials, Templates)50_Archive (Compost)This structure, combined with dataview queries (in Obsidian) or simple queries (in Logseq), allows for dynamic dashboards. For example, a dashboard can display "All Active Trees sorted by Due Date," dynamically generated from the YAML data.283. Strategic Filtering: The "No" EngineThe most critical function of governance for a solo creator is filtering. Without a rigorous mechanism to reject or delay ideas, the "Active" folder will overflow, leading to paralysis. This section details the mathematical and psychological tools used to filter the "Shiny Objects."3.1 The "Shiny Object" Defense ProtocolThe governance system imposes a mandatory "Incubation Period" (or "Cooling Off" period) for all new ideas. When a new idea is captured in the 00_Inbox, it is strictly forbidden to move it to 23_Trees immediately.11The 7-Day Incubation Rule:Any new "Seed" must remain in the nursery for a minimum of 7 days. This allows the initial dopamine rush (the "thrill of the new") to subside. After 7 days, the creator reviews the seed. If the excitement persists and the strategic value is clear, it can be promoted. If the excitement has vanished, it was likely just a distraction, and it is moved to 50_Archive.223.2 Adapted Scoring Models: RICE, ICE, and DICETo objectively compare disparate ideas (e.g., "Refactor website" vs. "Write ebook"), we utilize scoring matrices. While corporate RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) is standard, it lacks the personal dimension required for solo work.163.2.1 The DICE Model (ADHD Adaptation)We introduce the DICE framework, specifically engineered for neurodivergent solopreneurs. It adds a "Dopamine" multiplier to the standard ICE model.Dopamine (1-10): How intellectually stimulating or exciting is this?Impact (1-10): What is the effect on the "North Star" goal (revenue, growth)?Confidence (1-10): How sure am I that I can actually finish this?Ease (1-10): How low is the friction? (1 = Hard, 10 = Easy).The Formula:$$Score = (Impact \times Confidence \times Ease) + (Dopamine \times Weight)$$Why this matters: For an ADHD creator, a project with High Impact/High Ease but Zero Dopamine is a "Trap." It looks good on paper, but the creator will likely procrastinate indefinitely. By weighting Dopamine (e.g., a weight of 20 or 50), the system surfaces projects that the creator is psychologically capable of executing at this moment.14Table 3: Comparison of Scoring Models for Solo UseModelComponentsProsConsBest ForRICEReach, Impact, Confidence, EffortQuantitative, data-driven."Reach" is hard to estimate for early-stage solo projects; ignores motivation.Mature product management. 16ICEImpact, Confidence, EaseSimple, fast.Subjective; doesn't account for "boredom risk."Quick triage. 30DICEDopamine, Impact, Confidence, EaseNeuro-inclusive; accounts for motivation as a resource.Highly subjective; risks prioritizing "fun" over "profitable."Solo AI Creators / ADHD.3.3 The Decision Log: Preventing AmnesiaA common failure mode is re-litigating past decisions ("Why didn't I choose the other framework?"). To combat this, the Life OS must contain a Decision Log.31This is a simple Markdown table located in 10_Governance. Whenever a major strategic choice is made (or a project is killed), it is recorded.Table 4: Decision Log StructureIDDateDecisionRationaleAlternatives RejectedStatusD-0012023-11-01Adopt ObsidianLocal-first, AI-readable filesNotion (too slow), Trello (too rigid)ActiveD-0022023-11-15Kill PodcastHigh editing effort (Energy: 5), Low DopamineOutsourcing (too expensive)ArchivedThis log serves as an external memory bank, stopping the creator from circling back to discarded ideas.334. The Execution Engine: "Agile for One" & Personal KanbanOnce a project has passed the 7-Day Rule and scored high on DICE, it enters the execution phase. The methodology here shifts from "Strategy" to "Flow," utilizing Personal Kanban.4.1 Visualizing the WorkflowThe Kanban board is the central dashboard. It must be visual (not just a list) to remain salient to the ADHD brain.1 In Obsidian, this can be achieved via the "Kanban" plugin or by using a physical whiteboard replicated digitally.The Four-Column Structure:Ready (The Queue): A limited list (max 5) of tasks pulled from the backlog, fully groomed and ready to start.Doing (The Focus Zone): STRICT WIP LIMIT: 3. This is the non-negotiable rule.Blocked (The Waiting Room): Tasks waiting on external input (e.g., API keys, email replies).Done (The Trophy Case): Completed items.4.2 The Mathematics of WIP LimitsWhy limit Work In Progress (WIP) to 3? This is based on Little's Law and the cognitive cost of context switching.Context Switching Penalty: Research shows that working on 2 tasks simultaneously costs ~20% in setup time. Working on 5 tasks costs ~75%.1The "Stop Starting, Start Finishing" Rule: If the "Doing" column is full (3 items), the creator is physically prevented from pulling a new card from "Ready." They must finish a current task or formally move it back to "Ready" (acknowledging defeat/delay) to open a slot.34This mechanical constraint forces the "finishing" behavior that is often lacking in creative work.4.3 The "Definition of Done" (DoD)To prevent perfectionism—where a project lingers at 95% completion forever—every card in the "Ready" column must have a pre-defined DoD.22Bad DoD: "Write blog post."Good DoD: "Draft written in Markdown, spell-checked, header image selected, and file pushed to GitHub."The AI agent can be tasked to enforce this. If a user tries to move a card to "Done," the agent can ask: "Have you met all criteria in the DoD?".354.4 The "Expedite" LaneSolo creators often face emergencies (site down, critical bug). The Kanban board includes a horizontal "Expedite" swimlane at the top.Rule: Only ONE item can exist in Expedite. If a second emergency arises, the first must be resolved or demoted. This prevents "everything is urgent" syndrome.15. The AI Governance Layer: Agentic OrchestrationThis section details the primary innovation of this framework: using AI not just to create content, but to manage the creator. By leveraging the structured data (Section 2), we can deploy AI agents to act as the "Project Manager."5.1 The "Governance Agent" PersonaUsing tools like GitHub Copilot Workspace, Cursor, or local LLMs with system prompts, we define a specific persona for governance tasks.6System Prompt Architecture for governance_agent.md:name: Governance_PM
role: Agile Project Manager for Neurodivergent Solo Creator
context: You manage a user with high ideation but limited execution capacity.
capabilities: [backlog_grooming, risk_assessment, dice_scoring]DirectivesThe Gatekeeper: When the user proposes a new project, immediately ask for the DICE score components (Impact, Confidence, Ease, Dopamine). Do not let them start without scoring.The WIP Enforcer: Read the 23_Trees folder. If file count >= 3, REFUSE to add new projects. Reply: "WIP Limit Reached. Finish 'Project X' first."The Mirror: On Fridays, summarize the 50_Archive (completed) to show progress. Use encouraging language to boost dopamine.The Slicer: If a task sits in 'Doing' for >3 days, assume it is too big. Ask: "You're stuck. Let's break this down into 3 micro-tasks. What is the very first step?".65.2 Automated Backlog GroomingOne of the most tedious tasks is cleaning the backlog. The AI agent can automate this.37Workflow:Agent scans 21_Seeds.Identifies files unmodified for >30 days.Generates a report: "These 5 ideas have collected dust. Do you want to Archive them or prioritize them?"If "Archive," the agent moves the files and updates the frontmatter to status: compost.385.3 The "Readiness" Checklist AutomationBefore a project moves from "Sprouting" to "Active," the AI runs a readiness check to ensure feasibility.39Prompt: "Check Project_X.md. Does it have a defined Due Date? Is the Energy Cost estimated? Are dependencies [[Link]] valid? If not, flag as 'Not Ready'."This prevents the creator from starting projects that are doomed by lack of definition.6. Rituals and Rhythms: The Temporal ArchitectureGovernance is a rhythm, not a destination. We establish a cadence of reviews to maintain system hygiene.6.1 The Weekly Review: The "CEO Meeting"The Weekly Review is the single most important ritual. It is a meeting between the "Worker Self" and the "CEO Self".41Agenda (Friday Afternoon - 45 Minutes):Clear the Inbox: Process all loose notes in 00_Inbox. Delete, Delegate (to AI), or Defer (to Backlog).43Review the Board: Move completed items to Archive. Celebrate the wins (dopamine hit).Check Metrics: Look at the week's velocity. Did we clear 5 points or 50?The "Rose, Bud, Thorn" Analysis:Rose: What went well?Thorn: What hurt? (Identify recurring blockers).Bud: What new opportunities emerged?.44Plan Next Week: Select the "Big 3" for the Ready column. Constraint: Total estimated time must be < 60% of available hours (buffer for chaos).6.2 The Daily Standup (Self-Briefing)A 5-minute morning ritual to set the day's "North Star".45The "Short List": Identify the single most important task for the day.Energy Check: "My energy is currently a 3/5. I will tackle the admin task first to build momentum.".46Blocker Check: "I am waiting on API access. I will move that card to Blocked."6.3 Quarterly RetrospectivesEvery 90 days, the creator reviews the System itself.Are the DICE weights still accurate?Is the "Life OS" structure getting cluttered?Are we drifting from the "Why"?.467. Managing the Troughs: Recovery ProtocolsNo system is perfect. The ADHD creator will fall off the wagon. The system must be designed for "Graceful Failure" and "Rapid Reboot."7.1 The "Wall of Awful" and Micro-TaskingWhen a task feels impossible (The Wall of Awful), the AI agent is instructed to deploy "Micro-Tasking."Technique: Break the task down until the first step is "laughably easy."Example: "Write Report" -> "Open Laptop" -> "Create File" -> "Write Title."Mechanism: Completing tiny tasks releases micro-doses of dopamine, building the momentum needed to climb the wall.477.2 The "Bankruptcy" ProtocolIf the backlog becomes overwhelming (>50 active items) or the board is ignored for weeks, the creator declares "Task Bankruptcy."Action: Move everything to 50_Archive/Bankruptcy_Date. The board is wiped clean.Psychology: This removes the "debt" and guilt. The creator picks one new thing to start. The important stuff will resurface; the rest was noise.17.3 Energy Management over Time ManagementThe governance system respects the "hunting" nature of the ADHD mind. It does not force 9-to-5 consistency.The "Sprint/Rest" Cycle: Leveraging hyperfocus when it appears, but scheduling mandatory "Do Nothing" days to recover. The YAML energy_cost field helps track if the creator is consistently over-drafting their energy reserves.88. Implementation Guide: Building the StackThis section provides the specific "How-To" for setting up the tools.8.1 Tool Selection: Obsidian vs. LogseqBoth are valid "Life OS" candidates.Obsidian: Better for rigid folder structures, "Kanban" plugin support, and robust Dataview queries for dashboards. Recommended for those needing visual structure.48Logseq: Better for daily journaling and "block-based" outlining. Its "Properties" are powerful but the graph view can be chaotic for governance. Recommended for those who prefer a "stream of consciousness" workflow.28Recommendation: Obsidian is generally superior for the Governance aspect due to the dedicated Kanban plugin and extensive community support for "Agentic" integration via plugins like "Text Generator" or "Copilot."8.2 Setting up the AI AgentInstall: Use a plugin like "Smart Connections" or "Copilot" in Obsidian.Context: Point the agent to the 10_Governance folder so it "knows" the rules.Prompts: Save the "Governance_PM" prompt (Section 5.1) as a template.Workflow: Trigger the agent via a hotkey during the Weekly Review.8.3 The "Day 1" ChecklistCreate the folder structure (00_Inbox, etc.).Create the Kanban_Board.md file using the plugin.Define the YAML template.Perform a "Mind Dump": Write down every open loop in the Inbox.Apply the 7-Day Rule: Move almost all of them to 21_Seeds.Pick 1 project for 23_Trees.Start.ConclusionThe Cognitive-Adaptive Governance System represents a paradigm shift for the solo creator. It moves away from the "Industrial" model of project management—which prioritizes utilization, schedules, and output volume—toward a "Biological" model. This model prioritizes homeostasis, energy regulation, and sustainable growth.By integrating the rigid structure of Markdown-based data (the "Skeleton") with the adaptive intelligence of AI agents (the "Nervous System") and the visual clarity of Kanban (the "Eyes"), the solopreneur can transcend the limitations of their own executive function. The goal is not to become a machine that never stops, but to build a machine that allows the human to create, rest, and thrive without the constant static of chaos. In this garden, the "Shiny Objects" are no longer distractions; they are simply seeds waiting for their season.Deep Dive: Methodologies and Data StructuresA. Detailed Prioritization Logic: The Mathematics of "DICE"The DICE model is the mathematical engine of this governance system. It serves to objectify the subjective feeling of "I want to do this."A.1 Component Breakdown1. Impact (Weight: 1.0)Definition: The measurable contribution to the creator's long-term goals (Revenue, Audience, Skill Acquisition).Scale:10: Game Changer (e.g., Launching a flagship product).5: Incremental Improvement (e.g., Optimizing SEO).1: Maintenance (e.g., Updating plugins).2. Confidence (Weight: 1.0)Definition: The epistemic certainty that the project can be completed with current resources.Scale:10: "I have done this before."5: "I know how to Google this."1: "I have no idea where to start" (High risk of abandonment).3. Ease (Weight: 1.0)Definition: Inverse of Effort.Scale:10: < 2 hours work.5: < 1 week work.1: > 1 month work.4. Dopamine (Weight: 2.0 - Adjustable)Definition: The visceral level of excitement or "pull" toward the task.Scale:10: "I can't sleep because I want to do this." (Hyperfocus territory).5: "It's fine, I don't mind it."1: "I physically recoil at the thought." (Wall of Awful).A.2 Case Study: The "Podcast" DecisionScenario: A creator considers starting a podcast vs. writing a newsletter.Table 5: DICE Scoring SimulationFactorPodcastNewsletterReasoningImpact8 (High Reach)6 (Med Reach)Podcast has higher viral potential.Confidence3 (Never edited audio)9 (Writer by trade)Technical barrier is high for podcast.Ease2 (Heavy editing)8 (Text only)Newsletter is low friction.Dopamine9 (New!

The Newsletter (440) is the rational choice.Governance Override: If the creator insists on the Podcast, the AI agent suggests: "Your Confidence/Ease is too low. Create a 'Learning Project' first: 'Record 1 test episode' to raise Confidence/Ease scores before committing to the full project."B. The Weekly Review Agenda Script (Step-by-Step)This script is designed to be read by the creator or fed into the AI agent to guide the session.Phase 1: Clear the Mental RAM (10 Mins)"Open your 00_Inbox. We have [X] items.""For each item: Is it actionable? If no, Delete or Archive. If yes, move to 21_Seeds.""Open your calendar. Look at the past week. Did you miss anything? Capture it.""Look at next week. Any hard deadlines? create a Card in 'Ready' for them."Phase 2: Board Maintenance (10 Mins)"Look at the 'Doing' column. Be honest: Did you touch these tasks this week?""If NO: Move them back to 'Ready' or 'Backlog'. Clear the slot.""If YES but stuck: Mark as 'Blocked'. Add a comment explaining why.""Look at 'Done'. Take a moment to feel good about these. Move to Archive."Phase 3: Strategic Selection (10 Mins)"We have [N] slots open in 'Doing' (Max 3).""Review the 'Ready' column. Sort by DICE Score.""Pick the top [N] cards. Do they fit your energy for next week?""Commit. Close the board."C. Handling "Shiny Object Syndrome": The Incubation ProtocolThis protocol serves as the immune system against distraction.The "Cooling Off" Algorithm:Capture: Idea hits brain -> Capture in 00_Inbox. Do not research. Do not buy domain names.Tag: Add tag #incubating and date_added:.Wait: The governance agent hides this file from the "Active" view for 7 days.Review (Day 7+): Agent surfaces the idea during Weekly Review.Question: "Are you still excited about this?"If Yes: Calculate DICE score. Move to 21_Seeds.If No: Move to 50_Archive/Ideas.Why this works: It validates the idea (capture) without derailing current work (execution). It separates the dopamine of discovery from the dopamine of doing.D. The "Readiness" Checklist (Pre-Flight)Before any card moves from "Ready" to "Doing," it must pass this check. This prevents "False Starts."Markdown Checklist Template:Pre-Flight Check[ ] Definition of Done: Is it written down and binary (True/False)?[ ] Assets: Do I have the files/links I need? (Or is "Find files" the first task?)[ ] Time: Do I have a calendar block available for this?[ ] Energy: Is the energy_cost compatible with my week?[ ] Why: Remind me, why does this matter? (One sentence)..39E. Glossary of TermsLife OS: A holistic digital system (usually Obsidian/Logseq) managing knowledge, tasks, and projects.WIP (Work In Progress): The number of active tasks. Limiting this is the key to flow.Evergreen: A note or project that retains value over time, updated continuously.Frontmatter: The metadata at the top of a file (YAML) used by AI to understand the file's context.Context Switching: The cognitive cost of jumping between tasks. The enemy of the ADHD mind.Body Doubling: Working alongside someone (or an AI agent) to maintain focus.This report provides the exhaustive, nuanced, and actionable framework required for a solo AI creator to master their workflow, balancing the chaos of creativity with the rigors of execution.
