Neuro-Adaptive Governance Architecture: A Comprehensive Framework for the ADHD Solopreneur Using Personal AI Life Operating SystemsAbstractThe intersection of generative artificial intelligence, local-first personal knowledge management, and cognitive science presents a transformative opportunity for the neurodivergent solopreneur. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of a proposed "Neuro-Adaptive Governance" architecture designed specifically for the single creator who possesses high creative output but limited executive function, a profile characteristic of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Traditional project management methodologies—predicated on linear temporal progression and consistent neurochemical regulation—often exacerbate the "Solopreneur’s Paradox," where an abundance of ideas leads to execution paralysis. This report details the theoretical underpinnings and technical implementation of a "Personal AI Life OS" that functions as an externalized executive function. By leveraging Markdown-based data structures, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for idea management, and agentic Large Language Model (LLM) workflows for decision enforcement, the system provides a minimalist yet rigid governance layer. This architecture shifts the burden of prioritization, initiation, and inhibition from the biological brain to a digital substrate, enabling sustainable creative velocity without cognitive burnout.1. The Cognitive Dynamics of the ADHD SolopreneurTo engineer an effective governance system for the solo creator, one must first deconstruct the specific cognitive failure points that occur when standard project management (PM) tools interact with an ADHD nervous system. The failure of the solopreneur is rarely a failure of talent or ideation; rather, it is a structural failure of the environment to accommodate the unique "lumpy" energy profile of the neurodivergent mind.1.1 The Solopreneur’s Paradox: Divergent Capacity vs. Executive BottlenecksThe solo creator operates in a high-stakes environment requiring rapid role-switching between visionary strategy and mundane execution. For the neurotypical individual, this switching cost is manageable. However, for the individual with ADHD, this creates a fundamental conflict. The ADHD brain is often described as having a "Ferrari engine with bicycle brakes".1 It excels at divergent thinking, pattern recognition, and hyperfocus—traits that fuel innovation and rapid prototyping. Yet, the executive functions required to govern this engine—specifically working memory, inhibition, and temporal organization—are frequently impaired.2This discrepancy leads to the "Solopreneur’s Paradox": as the volume of high-quality ideas increases, the capacity to execute them effectively decreases. The cognitive load of managing the inventory of ideas consumes the energy required to execute them. The result is a portfolio characterized by high initialization rates but near-zero completion rates, creating a psychological feedback loop of shame and avoidance.31.2 The Failure of Traditional Project Management ParadigmsThe prevailing software paradigms for project management—exemplified by tools like Jira, Asana, and Microsoft Project—are built upon the "Rational Actor" model. This model assumes that the user possesses a consistent capacity for data entry, a linear perception of time, and stable motivation. These assumptions collapse when applied to the ADHD solo creator.41.2.1 Configuration Overhead as Cognitive TaxHeavyweight PM tools introduce "configuration overhead"—the mandatory metadata entry (due dates, tags, dependencies) required to track a task. For a large organization, this data is necessary for reporting. For the solo creator, specifically one with ADHD, this complexity becomes a "tax on time".4 Every click, dropdown menu, and modal window required to log a task creates friction. The ADHD brain, which is sensitive to dopamine-reward ratios, quickly calculates that the effort of managing the system outweighs the reward of using it. Consequently, the tool is abandoned, and the creator retreats to chaotic, unmanaged workflows.51.2.2 The Temporal Distortion of Gantt ChartsStandard governance relies on Gantt charts and rigid timelines. However, ADHD cognition is characterized by "Time Blindness"—a difficulty in perceiving the passage of time or estimating future durations accurately.1 A deadline set for three weeks in the future is perceptually non-existent until it is imminent, at which point it triggers a panic-induced hyperfocus. Static planning tools that display long-term horizons often fail to motivate action in the present, leading to the "Wall of Awful"—a psychological barrier built of accumulated guilt over past missed deadlines.2Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Governance Models on Neurodivergent CognitionCognitive FunctionTraditional PM Approach (e.g., Jira/Asana)Impact on ADHD NeurobiologyNeuro-Adaptive Approach (Personal AI Life OS)Task InitiationRequires manual breakdown of large deliverables; blank slate anxiety.Paralysis; high activation energy required to start.AI-assisted "prosthetic" initiation; micro-task decomposition.6Working MemoryMulti-view navigation; information hidden in sub-menus."Out of sight, out of mind" (Object Permanence failure).Context-rich "Heads-Up Display" (HUD); single source of truth.4InhibitionPermissive backlogs allow infinite addition of new tasks.Scope creep; distraction by novel "shiny objects.""Constitution-based" limits; AI enforces "Incubator" periods.7Time PerceptionStatic deadlines; linear Gantt charts.Procrastination until panic; unrealistic planning.Energy-based scheduling; visual progress bars for immediate feedback.8Reward SystemLong-term milestone completion.Low dopamine; loss of interest in "slog" phases.Gamified micro-completions; immediate visual feedback loops.51.3 The Neurochemistry of PrioritizationEffective governance is essentially a biological intervention. It must manage the user's neurochemistry as much as their task list. The ADHD brain is chemically driven by a search for stimulation (dopamine).91.3.1 The Importance of Perceived EffortStandard prioritization matrices, such as the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent vs. Important), fail because they treat "Effort" as an objective constant. For the ADHD brain, effort is highly variable and context-dependent. A complex creative task might feel effortless during a state of hyperfocus, while a simple administrative email might feel insurmountable during a dopamine dip.10A viable governance model must therefore replace "Time" with "Energy" as the primary constraint resource. It must continuously assess the user's current state—high focus, low energy, creative flow—and route tasks that match that biological reality.101.3.2 Object Permanence and Idea HoardingA distinct source of anxiety for the creative solopreneur is the fear of losing ideas. This phenomenon is linked to deficits in object permanence—the cognitive understanding that objects (or ideas) continue to exist even when they cannot be seen.3 This fear drives "Idea Hoarding," where the creator refuses to file an idea away for later because they believe "later" means "never."To counter this, the governance system must provide a technologically assured "Parking Lot." The user must trust—with absolute certainty—that the system possesses a mechanism to resurface that idea at the precise moment it becomes relevant. This requires more than a search bar; it requires Proactive Retrieval, a capability now possible through Vector Embeddings and RAG.112. The Personal AI Life OS ArchitectureTo implement this neuro-adaptive governance, we move beyond off-the-shelf software to a custom-architected "Life Operating System" (Life OS). This architecture prioritizes data sovereignty, interoperability, and low-friction interaction. The core philosophy is "Local-First, AI-Augmented."2.1 The Data Layer: Markdown as the Universal State MachineThe foundation of the Life OS is the file format. Proprietary databases (Notion, Tana, ClickUp) lock data behind APIs, introducing latency and rate limits that hinder real-time AI agents. Markdown (plain text) serves as the ideal substrate for this architecture.132.1.1 Why Obsidian and Markdown?Obsidian is selected as the interface layer not merely as a note-taking app, but as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the user's life.AI Readability: Large Language Models (LLMs) are natively trained on vast repositories of code and Markdown documentation. They can parse, modify, and generate Markdown structures with higher fidelity than complex JSON objects or proprietary schema.14System Interoperability: A folder of Markdown files can be accessed simultaneously by the user (via Obsidian), by a Python script (for RAG indexing), and by a local LLM (for analysis), without conflict.15Future-Proofing: Text files are immune to SaaS platform decay or pricing changes, satisfying the solopreneur's need for stability.152.2 The Metadata Schema: The "Perfect Frontmatter" StrategyFor an AI agent to effectively govern a portfolio, the unstructured text of notes must be wrapped in structured metadata. We utilize YAML Frontmatter at the head of every file to define the "State" of that object.16 This creates a machine-readable constitution for every atom of data in the system.Table 2: The Unified Frontmatter Schema for GovernanceFieldData TypePurpose & Governance LogicuuidStringUnique identifier for linking and vector tracking.typeEnumClassification: project, idea, resource, task.

Critical for ADHD motivation management.9parent_goalWikiLinkLinks tactical projects to strategic OKRs (Objectives and Key Results).kill_dateDateAuto-deprecation date. If inactive by this date, the agent moves it to Archive.This strict schema allows the AI agent to perform complex queries, such as: "Identify all 'idea' type notes with 'high-focus' energy requirements that have been in the 'incubator' for more than 30 days." This capability transforms a passive notebook into an active relational database.172.3 The Visualization Layer: Dataview DashboardsVisual feedback is critical for maintaining "Object Permanence." We employ the Dataview plugin within Obsidian to create dynamic, code-driven dashboards that replace the manual lists of traditional tools.18Instead of navigating folder hierarchies—which introduces friction—the user interacts with a single 00_Dashboard.md file. This file contains DataviewJS scripts that render real-time tables of the user's reality.Architectural Insight: By decoupling the storage of information (in individual files) from the viewing of information (the Dashboard), we minimize visual clutter. The Dashboard only shows what is relevant now, filtering out the noise that causes overwhelm.172.4 The Intelligence Layer: Agentic AI and RAGThe "OS" becomes intelligent through the integration of a Local AI Agent and a RAG pipeline.2.4.1 Local RAG for Object PermanenceTo solve the "Idea Overflow" problem, a local RAG pipeline indexes the Markdown vault. Unlike cloud-based search, this system is private and instant.Mechanism: A background process (e.g., a Python script using LangChain or similar libraries) chunks the Markdown files, embeds them using a lightweight model (like all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and stores them in a local vector store (e.g., ChromaDB or a simple FAISS index).11Function: When the user enters a new idea, the system performs a semantic search against the vault. It creates a "link density" map, showing how this new idea connects to past thoughts.Psychological Benefit: This provides the "technological assurance" required for the user to let go of an idea. Knowing that the AI can "remember" the idea based on vague conceptual queries later allows the user to inhibit the impulse to act immediately.32.4.2 The "Solo Swarm" OrchestrationWe utilize the Solo Developer Swarm Orchestration Pattern.6 This involves a single LLM (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o) configured via system prompts to act as multiple distinct agents:The Coordinator: Manages the backlog, enforces governance rules, and plans the day.The Body Double: Sits with the user during execution, providing micro-prompts and encouragement.The Critic: Reviews work for quality and scope creep.This multi-agent simulation provides the social scaffolding of a team without the overhead of actual employees.203. The Governance Constitution: The GOVERNANCE.mdIn open-source software development, a GOVERNANCE.md file defines how decisions are made, who has authority, and how conflicts are resolved. For the solo creator, this file serves as the "Constitution of the Self." It separates the Strategic Self (the boss) from the Tactical Self (the worker), creating a system of checks and balances that prevents self-sabotage.213.1 Defining the Solopreneur’s ConstitutionThis document must be stored in the root of the Personal Life OS (/00_Meta/GOVERNANCE.md) and must be read-only for the "Tactical Self." It is the first document the AI Agent reads before any planning session to ground its behavior.Key Articles of the Solopreneur Governance File:Article I: The Constraint of Finite Capacity (The "Bus Factor" of One)This article acknowledges that all resources—time, energy, attention—are finite. It explicitly limits "Work in Progress" (WIP) to prevent the dispersion of effort.Rule 1.1: There shall be no more than 3 Active Projects at any given time.Rule 1.2: To promote a project to "Active" status, an existing Active project must be either Completed or demoted to "Parked."Rule 1.3: Only one "Hyperfocus" (Deep Work) project is permitted per week. All other active projects must be in "Maintenance" mode.3Article II: The Protocol for New Ideas (The Cooling Period)To mitigate the impulse for novelty-seeking, this article governs the intake process.Rule 2.1: No new idea can be acted upon immediately. All new ideas must be captured in the Inbox and remain in the Incubator for a minimum of 48 hours (The Cooling Period).23Rule 2.2: After the Cooling Period, the idea is reviewed. If it still commands high dopamine and aligns with strategic goals, it may be eligible for promotion, subject to Rule 1.1.Article III: The "Kill" Switch (Deprecation Protocols)This article provides the criteria for abandoning a project without guilt, combating the "Sunk Cost Fallacy."Rule 3.1: Any Active project that receives no commits or meaningful updates for 30 consecutive days is automatically demoted to Archive.Rule 3.2: "Bankruptcy Mode": If the Inbox exceeds 100 items, the user is authorized to declare "Inbox Bankruptcy," moving all items to a dated Archive folder to restore psychological clarity.243.2 Decision Frameworks: IDE Scoring and MoSCoWTo prevent decision paralysis during the prioritization phase, the governance model dictates specific algorithmic frameworks.3.2.1 The Modified ICE Score: IDE (Impact, Dopamine, Energy)Standard ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) scoring is often too abstract for personal use. We modify this to fit neurodivergent needs, creating the IDE Score.10Impact (I): Strategic value. Does this move me closer to my annual goal? (Scale 1-10).Dopamine (D): Personal excitement/novelty. How much do I want to do this? (Scale 1-10). Note: Acknowledging dopamine is crucial for ADHD adherence.Energy (E): The inverse of effort. How easy is this to start? (Scale 1-10, where 10 is effortless).Priority Score = (Impact × Dopamine) ÷ (11 - Energy)The AI Agent calculates this score automatically based on the user's description.High Dopamine / Low Energy: Flagged as "Quick Wins" to build momentum.26High Impact / High Energy: Scheduled for "Golden Hours" (peak medication/circadian efficacy).5Low Impact / High Energy: Flagged as "Traps" (e.g., endless tweaking of a logo).3.2.2 The MoSCoW Method for Scope ControlWithin a specific project, scope creep is the enemy. The MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't) is enforced rigorously.27Constraint: The AI Agent is instructed to flag any task labeled "Could Have" and challenge the user: "Is this feature essential for the MVP? If not, I am moving it to the Backlog according to Article IV of the Constitution."3.3 Role Separation: The Maintainer vs. The MakerThe solo creator must adopt distinct personas to manage the different cognitive modes required for governance vs. execution.21Table 3: Governance Roles and ResponsibilitiesRoleFrequencyContextResponsibilitiesCognitive ModeThe ArchitectMonthlyStrategic ReviewReview GOVERNANCE.md, set quarterly goals, analyze RAG insights for pattern recognition.High Executive Function; Broad/Strategic.The MaintainerWeekly"Sunday Review"Groom the Active folder, process the Incubator, assign IDE scores, clear the Inbox.Tactical; Organizational; Ruthless.The MakerDaily"Deep Work"Execute the "Next Action" assigned by the Maintainer. Ignore the backlog.Flow State; Narrow Focus; Protected.The AI's Role: The AI Agent acts as the Chief of Staff. It does not have the authority to change the rules (The Architect does that), but it has the absolute authority to enforce them upon The Maker. This externalization of authority is key to bypassing the user's internal resistance.4. Agentic Workflows: The "Solo Swarm" in ActionThis section details the operational workflow where the AI acts as a prosthetic executive function. This is the practical implementation of "Agentic AI Security" applied to the self—securing the user's attention against internal threats (distraction, impulsivity) and external interruptions.204.1 The "Solo Swarm" Orchestration PatternRather than interacting with a generic chatbot, the user interacts with a system configured to switch between specific "Agents" or personas. This leverages the Solo Developer Swarm pattern, where different prompts simulate different team members.194.1.1 The Coordinator Agent (The "Boss")Function: Planning, Prioritization, and Constraint Enforcement.Trigger: The "Start Day" command.System Prompt Strategy: The prompt must be strict and rule-bound. It utilizes "Chain of Thought" reasoning to evaluate the user's state against the GOVERNANCE.md.28Sample Logic: "Review 03_Active. If User requests new task, Check Capacity. If Capacity == Full, Refuse Task -> Suggest Incubator."Interaction:User: "I want to build a new React app for tracking coffee beans."Coordinator: "That sounds like a valid idea. However, checking your dashboard, you are at capacity (3/3 Active Projects: 'Portfolio Site', 'Client API', 'Book Draft'). According to Article I, we cannot start this today. I have filed it in the Incubator. Let's look at it during the Sunday Review. For now, shall we focus on the 'Portfolio Site'?".64.1.2 The Body Double Agent (The "Partner")Function: Task Initiation, Momentum Maintenance, and Anxiety Reduction.6Trigger: Selection of a specific task.Psychological Mechanism: This agent mimics "Body Doubling"—a proven ADHD coping strategy where the presence of another person anchors attention.Workflow:Decomposition: The Agent takes a vague task ("Write Report") and breaks it into atomic units ("1. Open Document", "2. Write Header", "3. Paste Outline").Visual Progress: The Agent renders an ASCII progress bar in the chat window: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%. This provides the immediate dopamine feedback loop the ADHD brain craves.6Context Holding: If the user stops typing for a set period, the Agent sends a gentle nudge: "We were working on the Header. What's the next sentence?" This "Context Holding" prevents the user from drifting away during micro-distractions.4.1.3 The Interception Layer (The "Shield")One of the most valuable functions of the AI is to intercept "Side Quests"—the sudden impulses to research irrelevant topics.Scenario: The user is coding but suddenly wonders about the history of the printing press.Traditional Failure: User opens Wikipedia, loses 3 hours.AI-Governed Success: User types into the Agent Chat: "Who invented the printing press?"Agent Logic: The Agent detects the user is in "Deep Work Mode" on a coding task. It checks the relevance of the query.Response: "That's interesting, but it doesn't seem related to the 'API Logic' we are building. I have captured 'Research Printing Press' in your Inbox. It is safe there. Let's finish this function first.".74.2 Prompt Engineering for GovernanceTo achieve this high level of utility, the System Prompts must be rigorously engineered using advanced techniques like Few-Shot Prompting and Constitutional AI principles.Table 4: System Prompt Components for the Governance AgentComponentPurposePrompt Instruction ExamplePersonaEstablish Authority"You are the Governance Sentinel. You are benevolent but firm. You do not ask for permission to enforce rules; you enforce them."ConstraintsPrevent Hallucination"You have READ-ONLY access to 03_Active. You cannot delete files. You can only WRITE to 01_Inbox." 7ToneADHD Accommodation"Use short, punchy sentences. Avoid walls of text. Use emojis to signify status (e.g., 🛑 for stop, ✅ for go). Normalize ADHD struggles." 6Output FormatClarity"Always output the current 'State' of the session at the top of your response: `Current Task:4.3 Agent Constraints and SafetyAs AI agents become more autonomous, there is a risk of them hallucinating permission or modifying data destructively. We implement Agent Constraints at the infrastructure level.7Read/Write Separation: The Agent is given specific tool definitions. The write_file tool is scoped strictly to the 01_Inbox and 00_Meta/Logs directories. It cannot overwrite files in 03_Active without an explicit "Superuser Override" command.State-Based Refusal: The Agent is programmed to refuse tasks based on the system state. If the energy_profile in the Daily Note is set to "Low," the Agent will functionally refuse to schedule "High Effort" tasks, suggesting "Rest" or "Admin" instead. This protects the user from their own unrealistic optimism.295. Implementation Strategy: Building the SystemThis section provides the specific, step-by-step technical implementation of the Personal AI Life OS. It translates the theory into a deployable environment.5.1 Step 1: Obsidian Vault ConfigurationThe user initiates a new Obsidian Vault. The folder structure is created to mirror the governance flow.Directory Tree:/LifeOS├── 00_Meta│   ├── GOVERNANCE.md│   ├── Templates│   └── Scripts├── 00_Dashboard.md├── 01_Inbox├── 02_Incubator├── 03_Active├── 04_Archive└── 99_ResourcesRequired Plugins:Dataview: For the dashboards.Templater: For automated frontmatter insertion.30Omnisearch: For indexing the vault for text search.Local LLM Integration (e.g., Copilot, Text Generator, or custom script): To connect the vault to the Agent.5.2 Step 2: Automating Frontmatter with TemplaterTo ensure the "Perfect Frontmatter" is always used—solving the "Configuration Overhead" problem—we configure a Templater script that triggers on file creation. This script prompts the user for the minimal necessary data and auto-generates the rest.Script: New Project.md (Templater)JavaScript<%*
let title = await tp.system.prompt("Project Title");
let energy = await tp.system.suggester(["High Focus", "Low Energy", "Creative"], ["high", "low", "creative"]);
let impact = await tp.system.prompt("Impact Score (1-10)");
-%>
---
uuid: <% tp.file.creation_date("YYYYMMDDHHmm") %>
type: project
status: incubator
energy_profile: <% energy %>
impact_score: <% impact %>
created: <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %>
---
# <% title %>

[Enter the strategic reason for this project]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 
Insight: This script reduces the friction of "doing it right" to near zero. The user answers three prompts, and the governance structure is applied automatically.305.3 Step 3: The Dataview Governance DashboardWe create the 00_Dashboard.md file to serve as the "Head-Up Display." This file uses dataviewjs to query the live state of the vault.Code Block: Active Project MonitorJavaScript```dataviewjs
dv.header(2, "🚀 Active Projects Control Center");

// Fetch Active Projects
let active = dv.pages('"03_Active"').where(p => p.type == "project");

// Governance Check: Capacity
if (active.length > 3) {
    dv.paragraph("⚠️ **CRITICAL ALERT: CAPACITY EXCEEDED (" + active.length + "/3)** ⚠️");
    dv.paragraph("Please demote a project to 'Incubator' immediately.");
} else {
    dv.paragraph("✅ Capacity: " + active.length + "/3");
}

// Render Table
dv.table(["Project", "Energy Profile", "Impact", "Next Action"],
    active.map(p =>)
);
Insight: This dashboard provides immediate visual feedback on governance violations. The "CRITICAL ALERT" leverages the brain's "error detection" circuitry to prompt corrective action.175.4 Step 4: The Idea Parking Lot (RAG Implementation)We implement the "Proactive Resurfacing" system. While complex Python scripts can be used, a simplified version for the solopreneur can use Obsidian's built-in search or a lightweight plugin like "Smart Connections" (which uses embeddings).Workflow:Indexing: The plugin indexes all notes in 02_Incubator and 04_Archive.Retrieval: When the user is in the 01_Inbox writing a new idea, the Agent runs a "Find Similar" query.Resurfacing: The Agent appends a "Related Past Ideas" callout to the new note.Example: "You are writing about 'Generic AI Wrappers.' You have 3 archived notes on this topic from 2023. Link:]."This closes the loop on object permanence, proving to the user that the system "remembers," which allows them to safely archive the new thought and return to work.116. Daily Workflow & Lifecycle ManagementThe system is not static; it lives through the user's daily interaction. The workflow is designed to minimize decision fatigue by creating rigid "containers" for different types of work.6.1 The Daily Routine: A Script for SanityA predictable routine reduces the cognitive load of "figuring out what to do." The Personal AI Life OS enforces a "Sandwiched" routine.56.1.1 Morning: The "Download" (15 Minutes)Brain Dump: User dictates into the Mobile App. Everything goes into 01_Inbox.AI Sort: The Agent processes the dump. "You mentioned 'Call Mom' (Personal) and 'Fix Bug' (Work). I have filed them accordingly."Selection: The Agent presents the "Menu of the Day" derived from the Active folder, filtered by the user's current energy self-report.6.1.2 Mid-Day: The "Deep Work" (Body Doubling)User activates the Body Double Agent.Command: "Start Deep Work Session."Action: Agent sets a timer, blocks notifications (via integrations like "Freedom" or "Focus" if available), and begins the micro-tasking prompt loop.Cycle: 25 minutes Work / 5 minutes Break (Pomodoro). The Agent enforces the break: "Stop. Stand up. Drink water. I will wait here.".56.1.3 Evening: The "Shutdown" (10 Minutes)Log: User logs "Energy Level" and "Wins" into the Daily Note.Park: Any unfinished sub-tasks are pushed to the next day or moved to Incubator.Close: Visual confirmation from the Agent: "System Shutdown Complete. You have 0 open loops. Your ideas are safe. See you tomorrow."Psychological Impact: This explicit closing ritual helps the ADHD brain disengage from hyperfocus and transition to rest, reducing burnout.86.2 Managing System Entropy: The "Bankruptcy" ProtocolEven the best systems degrade. The "Novelty" of the system itself will wear off—a common ADHD pitfall. The governance architecture accounts for this through the Bankruptcy Protocol.The Problem: The Inbox accumulates 500 items. The user feels overwhelmed and stops opening the app to avoid the shame.The Solution: The Agent suggests "Bankruptcy Mode."Trigger: Inbox Count > 100.Action: The Agent moves all items in Inbox and Incubator to a folder named 04_Archive/Bankruptcy_YYYY-MM-DD.Philosophy: "If it was important, it would be Active. If it is vital, it will come back. We are clearing the deck to restore your sanity."Result: The user gets a fresh start without data loss (it is archived, not deleted), resetting the dopamine loop.247. ConclusionThe minimalist governance method for the ADHD solo creator is not about more discipline; it is about better architecture. It recognizes that "trying harder" is a failed strategy for executive dysfunction. Instead, it proposes a technological symbiosis.By combining Obsidian (as the resilient, local-first memory), GOVERNANCE.md (as the objective conscience), and Agentic AI (as the prosthetic will), the system creates a "Neuro-Adaptive Exoskeleton." This exoskeleton bears the weight of prioritization, inhibition, and memory, leaving the creator free to do what they do best: imagine, innovate, and create. This is not merely a productivity system; it is a survival mechanism for the modern, neurodivergent mind in an age of infinite information.
