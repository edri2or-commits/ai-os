Architectural Specification for the Neuro-Symbolic Life Graph: A Deterministic, Git-Backed Operating System for the ADHD Solopreneur1. Introduction: The Cognitive Crisis of the Digital SolopreneurThe contemporary digital landscape presents a profound paradox for the solopreneur, particularly one navigating the neurocognitive complexities of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While the market is saturated with productivity suites, task managers, and knowledge bases, the fragmentation of these tools creates a "cognitive tax" that disproportionately penalizes executive dysfunction. The ADHD brain, characterized by deficits in working memory, emotional regulation regarding task initiation, and time perception, requires an external operating environment that functions not merely as a repository of information, but as an active, prosthetic executive cortex. This report presents the architectural design for the Neuro-Symbolic Life Graph (NSLG), a personal operating system constructed to address these specific neurological realities.The central thesis of this architecture is that neither rigid, traditional databases nor purely generative, probabilistic AI models are sufficient for the ADHD use case. Traditional databases—the "Symbolic" approach—impose a friction of data entry and retrieval that often leads to system abandonment due to the high metabolic cost of maintenance. Conversely, the emerging wave of Generative AI—the "Neural" approach—offers low-friction interaction but suffers from hallucination, lack of persistence, and an inability to maintain long-term, deterministic state. The NSLG fuses these two paradigms into a Neuro-Symbolic architecture. It leverages the probabilistic power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle the messy, unstructured nature of human thought, while anchoring that intelligence to a rigid, Git-backed, schema-enforced filesystem that serves as the immutable "ground truth."This system is designed to be deterministic, meaning its core logic and data storage are predictable, version-controlled, and recoverable. It addresses the "Wall of Awful"—the emotional barrier to task initiation 1—by integrating "Dopamine Menus" 3 and automated body-doubling workflows directly into the operating system's kernel. By utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) 4, the system transforms passive text generation into active orchestration, allowing agents to manipulate the local environment securely. The result is a system that does not merely store tasks but actively regulates the user's cognitive load, bridging the gap between intention and action.2. Cognitive Ergonomics and the ADHD User ProfileTo architect a successful personal operating system, one must first deconstruct the "user" not as a generic entity, but as a specific neurocognitive profile with distinct failure modes and strengths. The NSLG is built upon a foundation of cognitive ergonomics that specifically targets the deficits associated with ADHD: executive dysfunction, time blindness, and object permanence issues.2.1 The "Wall of Awful" and the Physics of InitiationThe primary operational bottleneck for the ADHD solopreneur is not the execution of work, but the initiation of it. This phenomenon is frequently described in therapeutic contexts as the "Wall of Awful".1 This metaphorical wall represents the accumulated emotional friction associated with a task—layers of past failure, rejection sensitivity, shame, and anxiety that build up over time. When a user faces a task like "File Quarterly Taxes," they do not encounter a simple administrative action; they encounter a towering emotional barrier constructed from every previous instance of late filing, penalties, and self-recrimination.2Traditional productivity tools exacerbate this dynamic. A standard to-do list presents tasks as flat, text-based demands, devoid of emotional context or support scaffolding. The list effectively acts as a scoreboard of failure, increasing the height of the Wall. The NSLG architecture addresses this by treating task initiation as a state transition problem that requires "activation energy." The system integrates "Dopamine Menus"—structured lists of stimulating activities categorized by their metabolic cost and reward profile (Appetizers, Mains, Sides, Desserts).3 By digitizing these menus into the system's dashboard, the OS can suggest low-friction "Appetizers" to generate the initial dopamine required to scale the Wall, effectively automating the "climbing" strategies recommended by ADHD experts.62.2 Digital Object Permanence and the Working Memory DeficitA defining characteristic of ADHD is a deficit in working memory, often manifesting as a lack of "object permanence".9 In the physical world, this leads to losing keys the moment they are covered by a newspaper. In the digital realm, this results in the "out of sight, out of mind" phenomenon. Files nested three folders deep, browser tabs that are minimized, or tasks buried in a backlog effectively cease to exist for the user.This cognitive limitation is compounded by the "N x M" integration problem.4 A solopreneur might manage $N$ projects across $M$ distinct SaaS tools (Slack, Asana, Google Drive, Notion). The cognitive load required to maintain a mental map of where each specific asset resides is immense. The ADHD brain attempts to compensate for this by keeping everything visible simultaneously, leading to browser windows with dozens of open tabs—a state of visual clutter that induces paralysis.The NSLG solves this via a Knowledge Graph topology. Instead of relying on a hierarchical file tree (the "File Cabinet" model), the system utilizes a graph database structure (via Obsidian's underlying link index or a Neo4j overlay) where data points are interconnected nodes.11 This ensures "Index-Free Adjacency" 12, meaning that accessing a "Client Node" automatically surfaces the connected "Project Node," "Invoice Node," and "Meeting Notes," without the user needing to recall their specific file paths. The system externalizes the associative memory process, effectively functioning as a digital hippocampus.2.3 The Necessity of Determinism in AI ToolsWhile Generative AI offers immense potential for acceleration, its probabilistic nature poses a significant risk for neurodivergent users. ADHD individuals often struggle with detail-oriented verification and may be prone to "drift"—losing track of the original goal. An AI assistant that hallucinates a deadline or invents a project detail can cause cascading failures in the user's workflow.13Therefore, the NSLG enforces Determinism. The underlying data structure, task logic, and storage mechanisms must be rigid, rule-based, and predictable. The "Symbolic" half of the architecture provides this rigidity. By enforcing schemas through LinkML 15 and validating data inputs via n8n workflows 16, the system creates a "ground truth" that the AI can reference but not unilaterally alter without validation. This hybrid, Neuro-Symbolic approach ensures that the "Neuro" element acts as a creative interface and reasoning engine, while the "Symbolic" element acts as the immutable system of record.3. Theoretical Framework: Neuro-Symbolic ArchitectureThe Neuro-Symbolic Life Graph operates at the intersection of two distinct paradigms in computer science: Connectionist AI (Neural Networks) and Symbolic AI (Knowledge Representation). This hybridity is not merely a technical implementation detail but the core philosophy required to build a resilient system for a non-linear mind.3.1 The Neuro-Symbolic SpectrumHistorically, AI has oscillated between symbolic approaches—based on logic, rules, and ontologies—and connectionist approaches—based on statistical learning and neural networks. Symbolic systems (Good Old-Fashioned AI or GOFAI) are robust, interpretable, and precise. $2+2$ always equals $4$ in a symbolic system. However, they are brittle; they fail when faced with the messy ambiguity of human language or unstructured data.13 Neural networks, conversely, excel at pattern recognition and handling ambiguity but lack a fundamental understanding of truth, logic, or causality, leading to the well-known "hallucination" problem.4For a Personal Operating System (POS), neither approach is sufficient in isolation. A purely symbolic system (like a strict SQL database or a rigid Jira workflow) imposes too much structure, requiring the ADHD user to perform tedious data entry and categorization—tasks they are neurologically predisposed to avoid. A purely neural system (like chatting with ChatGPT) offers low friction but lacks context retention and factual reliability. The NSLG employs Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) to combine the best of both worlds.14The Symbolic Layer (The Cortex): This layer represents explicit knowledge, logic, and rules. It is implemented using a Git-backed filesystem of Markdown and JSON files, structured by a LinkML ontology. It handles facts: "Client X owes $500," "Project Y is due Friday." It is the domain of Determinism.The Neural Layer (The Intuition): This layer represents pattern recognition, natural language processing, and generation. It is implemented via LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT-4) accessing the symbolic layer through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It handles ambiguity: "Draft an email to Client X based on the tone of our last meeting," "Summarize the friction points in Project Y." It is the domain of Probabilism.3.2 The Life Graph OntologyThe central data structure is the "Life Graph," a unified knowledge graph that models the solopreneur's entire existence. Unlike corporate graphs that focus solely on business entities, the Life Graph recognizes that for an ADHD entrepreneur, personal health, dopamine regulation, and business operations are inextricably coupled. A missed night of sleep (Health Node) directly impacts the ability to code (Project Node).The ontology is defined using LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language).15 LinkML allows for the definition of classes, slots (properties), and relationships in a way that is machine-readable and convertible to various formats (JSON Schema, RDF, Python dataclasses).Table 1: Core Classes in the Life Graph OntologyClassDefinitionKey PropertiesSymbolic ConstraintProjectA bounded effort with a specific goal and deadline.status, deadline, client, wall_of_awful_levelMust be linked to Task nodes via has_part.TaskAn atomic unit of work required to advance a project.energy_cost (Low/High), context, is_blocked_byMust belong to a Project or Area.DopamineSourceAn activity providing stimulation or recovery.type (Appetizer/Main/Side), duration, stimulation_levelUsed in Recovery workflows.ResourceStatic knowledge, assets, or reference material.file_path, summary, tags, source_urlIndexed in Vector Database for RAG.PersonaAn entity (client, collaborator, family member).relationship_strength, communication_styleLinked to Meeting and Project.StateA snapshot of the user's cognitive condition.focus_level, emotional_valence, biometric_dataLogs used for pattern recognition.This ontology is enforced at the filesystem level. A Project is not just a vague concept; it is a specific Markdown file with YAML frontmatter that must adhere to the LinkML schema. If the user attempts to enter an invalid energy_cost, the symbolic validation layer—implemented via Metadata Menu in Obsidian or n8n validation nodes—flags or corrects it.203.3 Determinism through Version ControlThe system achieves its critical deterministic property through Git. Every state change in the Life Graph—whether a completed task, a new note, or a schema update—is a commit in a Git repository.22 This is not merely for backup; it serves as a temporal anchor for the ADHD mind.Time Travel: The ability to revert the system to any previous state is crucial for users who may impulsively delete or reorganize structures during a hyperfocus bout, only to regret it later.Auditability: A clear log of what changed and when provides an objective record of productivity, combating the "I did nothing all day" cognitive distortion common in ADHD.Synchronization: Git provides a conflict-resolution mechanism for multi-device workflows, ensuring that the state remains consistent across mobile and desktop environments.Git acts as the "immutable ledger" of the solopreneur's life. While the AI agents may suggest changes or draft content, the act of committing to Git is the final, human-verified seal of approval.4. Data Topology: The Git-Backed FilesystemThe physical layer of the NSLG is a local filesystem. This design choice prioritizes data sovereignty, longevity (plain text lasts forever), and speed. The system is agnostic to the specific text editor but is highly optimized for Obsidian due to its rich plugin ecosystem, local-first philosophy, and handling of Markdown.244.1 File Formats and Open StandardsThe system relies exclusively on open standards for data storage, ensuring that the user is never locked into a proprietary platform.Markdown (.md): Used for all narrative content, notes, and project definitions. It supports YAML Frontmatter for metadata, which serves as the machine-readable "header" for the symbolic layer.22JSON Canvas (.canvas): Used for spatial thinking, mind mapping, and visual dashboards. The JSON Canvas format 26 is an open standard that describes nodes (text, files, links) and edges (connections). This is critical for the ADHD brain, which often processes information spatially rather than linearly. It allows for the creation of "Command Centers" where all active contexts are visible at once.LinkML Schemas (.yaml): Used to define the structure of the data itself, ensuring consistency across the graph.4.2 Directory Structure and "Roots"To facilitate the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the filesystem is organized into "Roots".28 These roots define the boundaries within which the AI agents are permitted to operate, providing a security sandbox that prevents an agent from hallucinating deletions in critical system folders.The directory structure follows a modified PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) adapted for Neuro-Symbolic access 22:/LifeGraph (Git Root)├──.obsidian/              # Editor configuration (Symbolic UI state)├── 00_Meta/                # Ontologies, Templates, Scripts│   ├── schemas/            # LinkML definitions│   └── templates/          # Markdown templates for new nodes├── 10_Domains/             # High-level Areas of Responsibility (Health, Finance)│   ├── Business/│   ├── Health/│   └── Personal/├── 20_Projects/            # Active Projects (The "Workbench")│   ├── Active/│   └── Archived/├── 30_Resources/           # Zettelkasten/Reference (The "Library")├── 40_Dopamine/            # Dopamine Menu & Energy Regulation Strategies└── 99_Inbox/               # Unprocessed capture (The "Landing Zone")This structure is flattened where possible to reduce "clicking friction" (navigation depth), relying on Graph connections (Wikilinks [[Link]]) rather than folder hierarchy for organization. The 99_Inbox is the most critical folder; it serves as the dumping ground for capturing thoughts, preventing the disruption of flow. Automation agents later process this inbox, moving files to their correct semantic location.4.3 The Role of workspace.jsonObsidian's .obsidian/workspace.json file 23 maintains the state of the user interface—open tabs, pane layout, active plugins, and sidebar visibility. In the NSLG architecture, this file is elevated from a passive record to a programmatic target.The automation layer (n8n) or specific shell scripts can modify workspace.json or swap it with pre-configured variants like workspace-focus.json or workspace-recovery.json.30 This allows the system to physically reconfigure the user's screen based on their intent. If the user triggers "Deep Work" mode, the system programmatically closes all sidebar distractions, hides the file explorer, and opens only the relevant project file and the Focusmate timer. This reduces the executive function required to "set the stage" for work, effectively automating the environmental design process.5. The Neural Interface: Model Context Protocol (MCP) ImplementationThe core innovation of the NSLG is the extensive implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect LLMs (like Claude, OpenAI, or local Llama 3) to the local Life Graph.4 Prior to MCP, connecting an LLM to local files required complex custom integrations, risky data uploading, or manual copy-pasting. MCP standardizes this connection, creating a "USB-C port for AI applications".285.1 MCP Architecture ComponentsThe NSLG implements the three standard MCP components to create a seamless agentic workflow:MCP Host: The user interface for the AI interaction. This is typically Claude Desktop, an AI-enabled IDE like Cursor, or a custom-built Obsidian AI Plugin that acts as a host.31MCP Client: The internal bridge within the Host that translates natural language requests from the user (or the agent itself) into JSON-RPC messages.31MCP Servers: Standalone processes running locally that expose specific tools and resources to the LLM.5.2 Custom MCP Servers for the Life GraphThe NSLG utilizes a cluster of specific MCP servers to grant the AI full, but controlled, agency over the solopreneur's system.5.2.1 The Filesystem Server (mcp-filesystem)This server 29 is the primary interface for the "Neural" layer to interact with the "Symbolic" storage. It grants the LLM the ability to read and write Markdown files within the defined Roots.Resources: It exposes file contents as resources (e.g., file:///LifeGraph/Projects/Alpha.md).Tools:read_file: Allows the LLM to ingest context from existing notes.write_file: Allows the LLM to update notes, check off tasks, append meeting summaries, or refactor text.list_directory: Allows the LLM to explore the graph structure and "see" what projects are active.search_files: Semantic or grep-based search to find lost information, solving the object permanence issue.5.2.2 The Git Server (mcp-git)This server 34 provides the deterministic "save points" and audit trails.Tools:git_commit: The LLM can commit changes with a descriptive, semantic message (e.g., "feat: update project status based on client email").git_log: The LLM can review past work to synthesize progress reports—crucial for ADHD weekly reviews where the user may have forgotten their accomplishments.git_diff: The LLM can analyze what changed in a file to generate changelogs or catch accidental deletions.5.2.3 The Knowledge Graph Server (mcp-neo4j or mcp-graphrag)While the filesystem is the storage, the relationship logic often requires a dedicated graph database for complex querying (e.g., "Show me all tasks blocked by 'Client X' that are high energy").11Function: This server ingests the Markdown/YAML files, parses them via the LinkML schema, and loads them into a Neo4j or SQLite graph database.Tools:cypher_query: Allows the LLM to run complex graph queries to find hidden dependencies.find_related_nodes: Suggests connections the user might have missed, acting as a serendipity engine.5.3 Secure Interaction Flow via Progressive DisclosureThe interaction flow follows the Progressive Disclosure principle 36 to prevent token overload and ensure security. The LLM does not ingest the entire 20GB vault at once. Instead, it "walks" the graph:User Query: "Help me prepare for the meeting with Acme Corp."Tool Discovery: The MCP Host lists available tools from the Filesystem and Graph servers.Context Retrieval (Agentic Loop):The LLM calls graph_query to find files linked to "Acme Corp."It receives a list of relevant paths (e.g., Projects/Acme_Website.md, People/Alice_Acme.md).The LLM calls read_file specifically on these retrieved paths.Action:The LLM generates a briefing note summarizing open tasks and past interactions.The LLM calls write_file to save this as Meeting_Prep_Acme.md.The LLM calls git_commit to save the state.User Verification: The user opens Obsidian and sees the new file, ready for the meeting.This flow is deterministic because the tools (read/write/commit) are rigid code executions, even though the content generation is neural.6. The Semantic Layer: Schema and ValidationTo prevent the Life Graph from degenerating into a "digital junk drawer"—a common fate for ADHD organization systems—the architecture enforces a strict semantic layer. This layer ensures that data entering the system creates structure rather than entropy.6.1 LinkML as the Schema DefinitionLinkML 15 serves as the single source of truth for the system's ontology. It defines the "Shape" of the data, ensuring interoperability between the AI agents, the automation scripts, and the user interface.Example LinkML Definition for a 'Dopamine Activity':YAMLclasses:
  DopamineActivity:
    description: "An activity used to regulate energy and focus."
    attributes:
      name:
        type: string
        required: true
      category:
        type: string
        permissible_values:
          - Appetizer  # Quick, low friction (e.g., 5 min walk)
          - Main       # Deeply rewarding (e.g., Hobby project)
          - Side       # Concomitant (e.g., Listen to podcast while cleaning)
      energy_cost:
        type: integer
        minimum_value: 1
        maximum_value: 5
      url:
        type: uri
        description: "Link to the activity (e.g., YouTube playlist)"
6.2 Obsidian Metadata Menu for UI ValidationFor the user interface, the Metadata Menu plugin for Obsidian is utilized.20 This plugin reads the schema (mapped from LinkML) and creates typed, validated input fields directly in the Obsidian UI.Benefit: The user utilizes dropdown menus, date pickers, and auto-complete fields rather than typing raw YAML. This reduces the cognitive load of remembering whether the tag is #todo or #to-do.Validation: If the user attempts to input an invalid value (e.g., a text string in a date field), the plugin flags it. This ensures that the data remains clean for the Graph/AI layer to process later.206.3 n8n Validation NodesAt the automation layer, n8n workflows utilize JSON Schema validation nodes 16 to act as a gatekeeper. When an LLM generates a JSON object representing a new task or project, n8n validates it against the LinkML-derived JSON schema. If validation fails, the workflow routes to an error handling branch (e.g., asking the LLM to fix the format) rather than corrupting the database. This creates a "self-healing" data environment.7. Automation and Orchestration: The n8n Nervous SystemWhile MCP handles direct "User-in-the-loop" interactions, n8n serves as the background autonomic nervous system of the NSLG. n8n is a workflow automation tool that can be self-hosted, preserving the local-first, privacy-centric ethos of the architecture.387.1 The "Router Chain" Pattern for Intent ClassificationADHD users often struggle with sorting information. The "Inbox" becomes a terrifying pile of unmade decisions. n8n automates this sorting using Router Chains.40Workflow Logic:Trigger: A new file is added to 99_Inbox (via Obsidian, mobile capture, or email ingestion).Analysis: An AI Agent Node (using a local LLM or API) analyzes the text content.Router Logic:Intent: Actionable Task? $\rightarrow$ Extract due_date, priority. Move to 20_Projects/Tasks/.Intent: Reference Material? $\rightarrow$ Extract tags, summary. Move to 30_Resources/.Intent: Meeting Note? $\rightarrow$ Extract attendees, action_items. Move to 10_Domains/Business/Meetings/ and append a link to the Client node.Action: The file is moved, and the graph links are updated automatically.This "Auto-Filing" reduces the cognitive decision fatigue of "Where does this go?", which is a major source of friction and avoidance.7.2 Git Automation Workflowsn8n is configured with the Git Node 42 to manage the "Time Machine" aspect automatically.Scheduled Backup: Every hour, n8n triggers a git add. $\rightarrow$ git commit sequence.Semantic Commits: An LLM node analyzes the git diff and generates a semantic commit message (e.g., "feat: completed project alpha proposal" or "docs: updated daily journal").Conflict Resolution: If a sync conflict is detected, n8n creates a "Conflict Note" in the Obsidian Inbox for human review, rather than breaking the sync process.7.3 External API Integrationn8n bridges the gap between the local graph and external APIs, creating a unified operational picture.Google Drive/Obsidian Sync: n8n monitors specific Google Drive folders and converts new Google Docs into Markdown, injecting them into the Life Graph.44Focusmate Integration: While Focusmate lacks a comprehensive public API, integration is achieved via n8n by automating calendar events. When a user creates a "Focus Session" task in Obsidian, n8n creates a corresponding event on the calendar synced with Focusmate, effectively booking the session.458. The Gamification Layer: Dopamine Menus and Body DoublingFor the ADHD solopreneur, productivity is fundamentally a function of neurochemistry. The NSLG explicitly models stimulation as a resource to be managed via the "Dopamine Menu" concept.38.1 Digitizing the Dopamine MenuThe Dopamine Menu is implemented as a specific fileClass in Obsidian (and LinkML). The menu items are categorized by energy cost and stimulation type:Appetizers: Quick hits (e.g., "Check 3 emails", "Stretch", "Water plants").Mains: Deep work activities (e.g., "Code for 1 hour", "Draft proposal").Sides: Contextual helpers (e.g., "Lofi Hip Hop Playlist", "Fidget toy").Desserts: Rewards (e.g., "Scroll Reddit for 10 mins").Implementation via JSON Canvas:A JSON Canvas dashboard serves as the visual interface.26 The user opens the "Dopamine Dashboard" canvas.Randomizer: A script (via the Buttons plugin or n8n webhook) can pick a random "Appetizer" when the user clicks an "I'm Stuck" button.46Visual Cues: High-energy tasks are color-coded Red; restorative tasks are Green. This helps the user construct a "balanced meal" of work, preventing burnout.8.2 Integration with Focusmate/CavedayBody doubling—working alongside another person—is a potent ADHD intervention.47 The NSLG integrates this via webhooks.Trigger: User drags a "Deep Work" card into the "Active" slot on their Canvas dashboard.Action: n8n triggers a webhook to Focusmate (or Caveday via Zapier integration 48) to find the next available session matching the duration of the task.Feedback: The session time and link are written back to the user's daily note in Obsidian.This reduces the friction of finding accountability. The user signals intent via a simple drag-and-drop action, and the system handles the logistical complexity of booking and scheduling.9. User Interface: Obsidian as the Command CenterObsidian acts as the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the solopreneur's life. Its plasticity allows it to adapt to the user's changing cognitive needs.9.1 Workspaces as Cognitive ModesThe plugin Workspaces Plus 49 allows the saving and restoration of window layouts. The NSLG defines specific layouts for specific cognitive states, triggered via Advanced URI 50:Mode_Capture: Quick entry input only. No sidebar, no graph, no distractions.Mode_Clarify: Kanban board of tasks + Inbox list side-by-side.Mode_Reflect: Journal pane + Calendar + Graph view for connecting ideas.Mode_Execute: Single active pane (Zen mode) with the current task.The user can have a Stream Deck or desktop shortcuts mapped to these URIs (e.g., obsidian://adv-uri?workspace=Mode_Execute). This physical action creates an instant digital environment shift, utilizing the concept of Context-Dependent Memory to signal the brain to change its cognitive gear.9.2 JSON Canvas as a Thinking SurfaceThe JSON Canvas 26 is the primary interface for planning. Because it is a JSON file, the LLM agents can read and generate canvases.Use Case: The user asks the AI: "Map out the launch strategy for Product X."Agent Action: The MCP agent generates a .canvas file, creating nodes for "Marketing," "Dev," and "Sales," connecting them with edges representing dependencies.Result: The user opens Obsidian and sees a visual strategy map, fully editable, rather than a wall of text. This supports the ADHD preference for non-linear, spatial information processing.10. Security, Privacy, and Data SovereigntyFor the solopreneur, data is their livelihood. The NSLG prioritizes security through a "Local-First" architecture.10.1 Local-First Security ModelBy keeping the primary database as a local filesystem, the attack surface is minimized.No Cloud Leaks: Data is not stored in a third-party DB (like Notion or Asana) that could be breached.Encryption: The Git repository can be encrypted at rest. If syncing to GitHub/GitLab, Git-Crypt or using Private Repositories ensures confidentiality.10.2 PII and LLM Privacy GuardrailsThe MCP architecture allows for granular control over what data is sent to the Cloud LLM.32Opt-In Context: The LLM does not index the whole vault by default. It only reads files explicitly added to the "Context Window" by the user or the Agentic logic via the read_file tool.Local Inference: For highly sensitive data (e.g., medical records, financial strategy), the user can switch the MCP Model to a local LLM (e.g., Llama 3 via Ollama). This ensures that the data never leaves the physical machine 53, providing a privacy guarantee that SaaS AI tools cannot match.11. ConclusionThe Neuro-Symbolic Life Graph represents a paradigm shift from "productivity tools" to "cognitive architecture." For the ADHD solopreneur, it replaces the fragile reliance on willpower with a resilient, deterministic system. By fusing the creative assistance of LLMs with the rigid truth of Git and Knowledge Graphs, the system provides both the spark to start and the structure to finish. It is not merely a piece of software; it is a digital environment engineered to accommodate the unique physics of the neurodivergent mind, turning the chaos of solopreneurship into a navigable, meaningful graph of life.
