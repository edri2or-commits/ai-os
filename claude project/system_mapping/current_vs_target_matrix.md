# Current vs. Target Architecture Matrix

**Purpose:** Map existing repository elements to target architecture roles  
**Methodology:** Compare current_state_map.md against target_architecture_summary.md  
**Output:** Action plan for each element (keep/move/refactor/deprecate)  

---

## Matrix Legend

**Action Codes:**
- ✅ **keep/as-is** – Already aligned with target, no changes needed
- 🔄 **move/rename** – Relocate or rename to match target structure
- ⚙️ **refactor** – Restructure contents/format to match target spec
- ⚠️ **investigate** – Unclear status, needs analysis before decision
- 🗑️ **deprecate** – Legacy component, phase out over time
- 🆕 **missing** – Required by target but doesn't exist yet

**Target Roles:**
- **Memory Bank** – Truth Layer files (Markdown/YAML)
- **Vault** – Life Graph structured data
- **Governance** – DEC, snapshots, fitness metrics
- **Observability** – Logs, events, monitoring
- **Infrastructure** – n8n, Docker, services
- **Kernel** – Claude Desktop orchestration
- **Tools/MCP** – MCP servers, integrations
- **Legacy** – Unclear fit or superseded

## Section 9: Missing Components (Required by Target)

### 9.1 Memory Bank / Vault (Target Role: Life Graph)

| Current Path | Type | Target Role | Action | Notes / Sources |
|--------------|------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **NOT FOUND** | dir | Memory Bank | 🆕 missing | PARA-inspired structure (00_Inbox, 10_Projects, 20_Areas, 30_Resources, 99_Archive). **Sources:** 01, 04, 12 |
| **NOT FOUND** | dir | Vault | 🆕 missing | Life Graph entities (Area, Identity, Context, Project, Task, Log). **Sources:** 12 |

**Key Decision:**
- **CRITICAL MISSING:** Core memory structures not implemented
- Life Graph schema exists in research (file 12) but not in repo
- This is a major gap between current and target

**Action Required:**
- Create memory-bank/ directory with PARA structure
- Define schema for entities (YAML frontmatter)
- Implement or plan vector memory integration (Qdrant/LanceDB)

---

### 9.2 Circuit Breakers (Target Role: Safety)

|--------------|------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **NOT FOUND** | file/module | Safety (Circuit Breakers) | 🆕 missing | Loop detection, rate limiting, kill switch. **Sources:** 13, msg_020 |

**Key Decision:**
- Circuit breakers defined in research but not implemented
- Safety-critical feature

**Action Required:**
- Implement circuit breaker logic (possibly in services/os_core_mcp/)
- Add to governance metrics (FITNESS_001 - friction tracking)

---

### 9.3 Observer Pattern (Target Role: Drift Detection)

| Current Path | Type | Target Role | Action | Notes / Sources |
|--------------|------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| `services/os_core_mcp/reconciler.py` | file | Observability (Partial Observer) | ⚙️ refactor | reconciler_v1 exists but runs on-demand. Target suggests proactive Observer. **Sources:** 08, 13 |
| **NOT FOUND** | file | Observability (Full Observer) | 🆕 missing | Proactive drift detection (read-only probing every 10-30 min). **Sources:** 08, msg_020 |

**Key Decision:**
- reconciler_v1 is reactive (on-demand)
- Target spec calls for proactive Observer (Phase 2.4)
- Current drift (Git HEAD mismatch) suggests Observer needed

**Action Required:**
- Extend reconciler or create observer.py
- Schedule via n8n (every 10-30 min)
- Write OBSERVED_STATE.json
- Generate CRs (Change Requests) for drift

---

### 9.4 Host-Agnostic Interface Layer

| Current Path | Type | Target Role | Action | Notes / Sources |
|--------------|------|-------------|--------|-----------------|

## Section 10: Critical Drift Issues

### 10.1 Git HEAD vs. Truth Layer Mismatch

| Issue | Current State | Target State | Action | Notes / Sources |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Git HEAD mismatch | Truth Layer reports `43b308a` but actual HEAD is `41581fae...` | Truth Layer should auto-update from Observer | ⚙️ refactor | Implement proactive Observer to detect and report this drift. **Sources:** 08, 13 |

**Key Decision:**
- This is the exact drift problem documented in research
- reconciler_v1 exists but didn't catch this
- Observer (Phase 2.4) is the solution

---

### 10.2 Duplicate Event Timelines

| Issue | Current State | Target State | Action | Notes / Sources |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Two EVENT_TIMELINE.jsonl files | Root and docs/system_state/timeline/ | Single append-only log | 🔄 move/rename | Remove root duplicate, use only docs/system_state/timeline/EVENT_TIMELINE.jsonl. Update any scripts that reference root file. **Sources:** 08 |

---

## Summary: Action Categories

### ✅ Keep As-Is (Well-Aligned)

**Count:** ~40 items

**Categories:**
- Truth Layer files (SYSTEM_STATE_COMPACT, EVENT_TIMELINE, SERVICES_STATUS)
- Governance snapshots and snapshot generation
- All 4 MCP servers (GitHub, Google, OS Core, Agent Kernel)
- n8n infrastructure
- Core documentation (CONSTITUTION, DECISIONS, CAPABILITIES_MATRIX)
- Policies (Security, Human-Tech Interaction)
- Instructions & playbooks (kernel instructions, chat bootstrap)
- Agent & workflow documentation

**Justification:** These components already implement target architecture correctly.

---

### ⚠️ Investigate (Unclear Status)

**Count:** ~25 items

**Categories:**
- ai_core/ components (action_executor, agent_gateway, gpt_orchestrator, etc.)
- tools/ Python scripts (repo_bootstrap, repo_introspection, etc.)
- scripts/ automation (PR workers, slice publishers, etc.)
- Root-level scripts (start*.py, demo*.py, test*.py, etc.)
- services/ utilities (chat1_status_updater, claude_healthcheck)
- Docker files (root Dockerfile, Dockerfile.google)
- Directories (docs/system_state/outbox/, governance/DEC/, governance/EVT/)

**Justification:** Status unclear – need to determine if active, legacy, or superseded.

**Investigation Plan:**
1. Check imports/dependencies (what imports ai_core/?)
2. Check git history (last modified when?)
3. Check documentation (referenced where?)
4. Test execution (do they run?)
5. Decision: keep/refactor/deprecate based on findings

---

### 🔄 Move/Rename (Misplaced)

**Count:** ~3 items

**Items:**
- `EVENT_TIMELINE.jsonl` (root) → remove (duplicate)
- Possibly some test_*.py files → move to tests/

**Justification:** Duplicates or misplaced files.

---

### ⚙️ Refactor (Needs Implementation/Update)

**Count:** ~5 items

**Items:**
- `governance/scripts/measure_friction.py` (stub → implement)
- `governance/scripts/measure_cci.py` (stub → implement)
- `governance/scripts/measure_tool_efficacy.py` (stub → implement)
- `services/os_core_mcp/reconciler.py` (reactive → proactive Observer)
- `claude project/research_claude/` (active → archive after migration)

**Justification:** Partial implementation or needs evolution per target spec.

---

### 🗑️ Deprecate (Legacy/Duplicate)

**Count:** ~6 items

**Items:**
- `claude project/Knowl/` (duplicate of research_claude/)
- `claude project/מחסן מחקרים/` (duplicate research warehouse)
- `maby relevant/`, `mcp/`, `מחקרי ארכיטקטורה/` (empty legacy dirs)
- Potentially ai_core/ if superseded (pending investigation)

**Justification:** Duplicates, empty directories, or superseded by MCP architecture.

---

### 🆕 Missing (Required by Target)

**Count:** ~6 major gaps

**Critical Missing:**
1. **Memory Bank** (PARA structure: 00_Inbox, 10_Projects, 20_Areas, etc.)
2. **Vault** (Life Graph entities with YAML frontmatter)
3. **Vector Memory** (Qdrant/LanceDB integration)
4. **Circuit Breakers** (loop detection, rate limiting, kill switch)
5. **Proactive Observer** (drift detection every 10-30 min)
6. **Host-Agnostic Interface Layer** (ChatGPT/Gemini clients)

**Justification:** Target architecture requires these, but they don't exist yet.

---

## Migration Priorities (Preview of Step 4)

Based on this matrix, migration should prioritize:

**Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup**
1. **Investigate Unclear Components** (ai_core/, scripts/, tools/)
2. **Remove Duplicates** (EVENT_TIMELINE root, Knowl/, מחסן מחקרים/)
3. **Consolidate Scripts** (clarify start*.py, test*.py, demo*.py)

**Phase 2: Core Memory (Critical Gap)**
4. **Create Memory Bank Structure** (PARA folders)
5. **Define Life Graph Schema** (YAML templates)
6. **Plan Vector Memory** (Qdrant/LanceDB)

**Phase 3: Observability & Safety**
7. **Implement Circuit Breakers** (safety-critical)
8. **Build Proactive Observer** (drift detection)
9. **Implement Measurement Scripts** (FITNESS_001, _002, _003)

**Phase 4: Future Features**
10. **Host-Agnostic Interfaces** (multi-client support)
11. **Advanced Automations** (n8n workflows)

---

## Open Questions for Migration Planning

1. **ai_core/ Status:**
   - Is this pre-MCP architecture?
   - Which components (if any) are still used?
   - Can we safely deprecate or do we need migration?

2. **DEC/EVT Structure:**
   - Why only 1 file each in governance/DEC/ and governance/EVT/?
   - Is docs/DECISIONS_AI_OS.md the authoritative decision log?
   - Should governance/DEC/ be deprecated or expanded?

3. **Memory Bank Priority:**
   - Can Phase 0 → Phase 1 migration happen without Memory Bank?
   - Or is Memory Bank foundational and should be created first?

4. **Observer Timing:**
   - Should Observer (Phase 2.4 in current plan) be earlier?
   - Current drift suggests Observer is critical

5. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Many test_*.py files in root
   - Should these move to tests/ or are they demos?
   - What's the relationship to test/bootstrap_responses/?

---

## Next Steps

**After approval of this matrix:**

📋 **Step 4: migration_plan.md**

The migration plan will:
- Organize matrix items into phases and slices
- Prioritize based on risk, dependencies, and value
- Define clear success criteria for each slice
- Specify which research docs justify each slice

**Awaiting approval to proceed to Step 4.**
