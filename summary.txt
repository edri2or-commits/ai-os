# QUICK STATUS

**AI Life OS | Phase 2: Architectural Alignment & Governance** 📐

**Progress:** ~78% complete (H3 Telegram Approval Bot TESTED & OPERATIONAL! 🎉)

**Current Work (2025-12-06 - 19:05):**
- ✅ **H2 API: /story Endpoint Added** (2 min)
  - **Context:** User preparing GPT consultation, discovered /story endpoint missing (404)
  - **Solution:** Added GET /api/context/story endpoint
    - Returns: Full AI_LIFE_OS_STORY.md (12.5KB, 292 lines)
    - Metadata: File stats + Git SHA
  - **Implementation:**
    - Added route handler to services/context-api/main.py (+31 lines)
    - Restarted H2 (PID 25388)
    - Tested: 200 OK ✅

  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Previous Work (2025-12-06 - 18:45):**
- ✅ **H2 API Enhancement: GPT Integration Endpoints** (10 min)
  - **Context:** User wants to consult GPT about H4 VPS strategy using H2 API
  - **Problem:** Existing /current-state endpoint returns 101KB (1,894 lines) - too much for GPT
  - **Solution:** Added 2 new endpoints optimized for external LLM consumption
  - **Endpoints Added:**
    - `GET /api/context/summary` - First 100 lines of 01-active-context.md (5.7KB)
      - Contains: Quick Status, Current Work, Recent Changes, Next Steps
      - Metadata: Phase info, progress %, line counts, Git SHA
    - `GET /api/context/roadmap` - HEADLESS_MIGRATION_ROADMAP_TLDR.md (4.6KB)
      - Contains: H1→H2→H3→H4 plan, progress (3/4 complete), purpose
  - **Testing:** Both endpoints return 200 OK, correct content
  - **Files Modified:**
    - services/context-api/main.py (+72 lines)
    - Git commit c173ad5
  - **Impact:** GPT can now onboard in < 30s with minimal tokens
  - **Next:** User will consult GPT about H4 VPS strategy
  - **Duration:** 10 minutes
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Previous Work (2025-12-06 - 18:15):**
- ✅ **Documentation Accuracy: Service Status Correction** (5 min)
  - **Context:** User challenged claimed "OPERATIONAL" status for H1/H2/H3
  - **Discovery:** Services exist and work, but not 24/7 auto-start (awaiting H4 VPS)
  - **Root Cause:** Undefined "OPERATIONAL" - mixing EXISTS, WORKS, AUTO-START, 24/7
  - **Solution:** Defined Status Levels (STAGED/TESTING/PRODUCTION)
  - **Changes:**
    - H1 Gmail API: ✅ OPERATIONAL → 🟡 STAGED (ready for VPS deployment)
    - H2 Context API: ✅ OPERATIONAL → 🟡 STAGED (manual start works, awaits auto-start)
    - H3 Telegram Bot: ✅ OPERATIONAL → 🟢 TESTING (running locally, ready for VPS)
  - **Files Updated:**
    - memory-bank/TOOLS_INVENTORY.md (added Status Levels legend)
    - Git commit 974eac1
  - **Impact:** Honest documentation, clear H4 VPS purpose
  - **Meta-Learning:** Same pattern as Judge Agent - claimed operational without verification
  - **Duration:** 5 minutes
  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Previous Work (2025-12-06 - 18:00):**
- 📝 **Status Correction: Judge Agent** (HONESTY UPDATE)
  - **Discovery:** Previous documentation claimed "PRODUCTION OPERATIONAL" but system not actually working
  - **Reality:** Judge Agent workflow exists but non-functional (exact issue unknown)
  - **History:** Multiple troubleshooting attempts, significant time invested, no success
  - **Decision:** DEFERRED to post-VPS (Phase 2.5 can wait, H4 VPS is priority)
  - **Rationale:** Don't let perfect (Judge) block good (VPS 24/7 uptime)
  - **Status:** ❌ NOT OPERATIONAL (workflow exists, functionality broken)

**Just Finished (2025-12-06 - 13:27):**
- ✅ **Slice H3: Telegram Approval Bot** (TESTED SUCCESSFULLY! 🎉)
  - **Goal:** Async Human-in-the-Loop approvals via Telegram (no Claude Desktop required)
  - **Status:** PRODUCTION VERIFIED ✅ (end-to-end test passed)
  - **Integration:** Reconciler → CR file → Telegram notification → User approval → Database
  - **Impact:** Headless HITL, ADHD-friendly (approve from phone), 24/7 ready
  - **Test Results:** CR detected (5s), Telegram sent ✅, User approved ✅, DB updated ✅

**Achievement Unlocked:**
- ✅ Professional telemetry infrastructure (replaces naive JSONL)
- ✅ Visual dashboard at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Foundation for self-learning loop complete
- ✅ **Systematic cleanup validated** (Dashboard-First + Verification Protocol)
- ❌ **Judge Agent:** Workflow created but NOT operational (deferred to post-VPS)
