chore(migration): Archive tools/ one-time utilities

- Moved tools/ → archive/one-time/tools/
- Reason: One-time repo initialization utilities, no active usage
- Components archived:
  * repo_bootstrap_agent.py - Initial directory setup (deprecated)
  * repo_introspection_agent.py - Repo analysis (one-time)
  * repo_reader_base.py - Base class (unused)
  * system_init.py - System initialization (one-time)
  * TOOLS_INVENTORY.md - Documentation

Impact:
- Zero expected breakage (no imports, no references)
- All one-time utilities, no longer needed

Evidence (from Slice 1.1a):
- ZERO external imports found in codebase
- Code quality issues (typos) suggest never production-grade
- Directory structure they create already exists

Migration:
- Slice: 1.2b (Phase 1 cleanup)
- Refs: INVESTIGATION_RESULTS.md (Slice 1.1a findings)
- Pattern: Archive > Delete (safety-first)
- Rollback: git revert HEAD or git mv archive/one-time/tools tools/

Documentation Updated:
- docs/INVESTIGATION_RESULTS.md - Added migration completion note
- claude project/system_mapping/migration_plan.md - Marked Slice 1.2b complete
- claude project/system_mapping/current_vs_target_matrix.md - Updated tools/ status
- claude project/system_mapping/current_state_map.md - Updated directory structure
- archive/one-time/README.md - Created archive documentation

Architecture:
- Cleanup: One-time utilities completed their purpose
- Pattern: Preserve in archive for historical reference
- Alignment: Safety/Governance research family - "Prevention < Recovery"
