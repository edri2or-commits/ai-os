## Summary

This PR introduces the first two infrastructure slices of AI-OS v2:

### Slice 1: Governance Layer Bootstrap V1 + OS Core MCP Minimal
- **Governance Layer Bootstrap V1**:
  - Created `/governance` directory structure (DEC/, EVT/, metrics/, scripts/, snapshots/)
  - Added 4 stub measurement scripts (friction, CCI, tool_efficacy, snapshot)
  - Aligns with CONTROL_PLANE_GOVERNANCE_SPEC_V1 for FITNESS_001/002/003

- **OS Core MCP Minimal**:
  - Created `services/os_core_mcp/` as unified HTTP gateway to State Layer
  - FastAPI server on port 8083 with 3 endpoints:
    - GET /state → read SYSTEM_STATE_COMPACT.json
    - GET /services → read SERVICES_STATUS.json
    - POST /events → append to EVENT_TIMELINE.jsonl
  - Relative paths from repo root (no hardcoded paths)
  - Full error handling (404/500) + logging
  - CORS enabled for GPT Actions integration

### Slice 2A: Daily Context Sync V1 (Agent Kernel + LangGraph)
- **OS Core MCP Extended**:
  - Added POST /state/update endpoint for state patch merging
  - Top-level merge support into SYSTEM_STATE_COMPACT.json
  - Returns updated state with error handling

- **Agent Kernel + LangGraph**:
  - Created `services/agent_kernel/` as LangGraph-based workflow engine
  - FastAPI server on port 8084
  - Implemented first workflow: daily_context_sync_graph with 3 nodes:
    1. start_node: Read state + log STARTED event
    2. compute_patch: Generate timestamp patch
    3. apply_patch: Apply patch + log COMPLETED event
  - Full smoke test suite included and verified

## Testing
- ✅ Slice 1: Smoke test passed (all 4 endpoints operational)
- ✅ Slice 2A: End-to-end smoke test passed:
  - /daily-context-sync/run updates last_daily_context_sync_utc
  - Events DAILY_CONTEXT_SYNC_STARTED/COMPLETED written to timeline
  - State file updated correctly

## Decisions
- **DEC-008**: Governance Layer Bootstrap + OS Core MCP Minimal
- **DEC-009**: Slice 2A – Daily Context Sync V1

## Phase & Mode
- **Phase**: 2.3 (INFRA_ONLY)
- **Mode**: Infrastructure work, no live automations yet

## Next Steps (Slice 2B - Not in this PR)
- n8n workflow integration:
  - Cron/manual trigger for daily context sync
  - HTTP POST to Agent Kernel /daily-context-sync/run
  - Basic retry logic for network failures
- Langfuse observability preparation
- Additional workflows (weekly summary, governance metrics)

## Files Changed
**Slice 1:**
- governance/ (new directory structure + 4 stub scripts + README)
- services/os_core_mcp/ (new service: server.py, README, requirements.txt, smoke_test.py)
- docs/DECISIONS_AI_OS.md (added DEC-008)
- docs/system_state/timeline/EVENT_TIMELINE.jsonl (added events)

**Slice 2A:**
- services/os_core_mcp/server.py (added POST /state/update)
- services/agent_kernel/ (new service: complete LangGraph workflow engine)
- docs/system_state/SYSTEM_STATE_COMPACT.json (added last_daily_context_sync_utc)
- docs/system_state/timeline/EVENT_TIMELINE.jsonl (added workflow + bootstrap events)
- docs/DECISIONS_AI_OS.md (added DEC-009)
