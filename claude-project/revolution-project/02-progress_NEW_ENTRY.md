- Zero fabrication or speculation
- Uncertainty stated explicitly where applicable

#### 4. ADHD Context Integration
Every research domain explicitly addresses:
- How it supports executive function
- How it reduces cognitive load
- How it can be automated

**System = External Executive Cortex:**
- Working Memory → Git
- Time Blindness → n8n
- Context Switching → Batching
- Object Permanence → Files

**Evidence it's achievable (2024-2025):**
- MIT Darwin-Gödel Machine (self-modifying code works)
- Amazon Q (4,500 dev-years saved)
- Beam AI (200+ production agents)
- DeepMind Co-Scientist (autonomous research)
- GPT-5.1 (74.9% coding, 94.6% math)

### Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: GPT Version Confusion
**Problem:** Initially researched GPT-4 instead of GPT-5.1  
**Solution:** User corrected, re-researched GPT-5.1 specifically  
**Lesson:** Always verify exact model versions with user

#### Challenge 2: Context File Selection
**Problem:** 29 files available, need to select optimal subset  
**Solution:** Applied 90% coverage principle - 4 files provide essential context without overwhelming GPT-5.1  
**Lesson:** More context ≠ better results; focused context reduces cognitive load

#### Challenge 3: Research Domain Scoping
**Problem:** Could identify 20+ research domains  
**Solution:** Limited to 10 most critical domains directly addressing the 7 gaps  
**Lesson:** Depth over breadth; 10 comprehensive briefs better than 20 superficial ones

### Integration with Revolutionary Plan

**This Slice Enables:**
- ✅ **Layer 0 Validation:** Infrastructure assumptions will be validated by research
- ✅ **Layer 1 Specifications:** Research will inform technical specs for autonomous operations
- ✅ **Layer 2 Architecture:** RL and self-improvement patterns will guide Layer 2 design
- ✅ **Layer 3 Automation:** Research automation patterns will define Layer 3 implementation
- ✅ **95% Confidence Goal:** 10 research reports will provide empirical evidence

**Unblocks:**
- Technical specification creation (blocked on research validation)
- Implementation planning (blocked on proven patterns)
- Risk assessment (blocked on failure mode analysis)
- Architecture finalization (blocked on evidence-based decisions)

### Meta-Learning Triggers Detected

#### Trigger A: Research Before Architecture (New Pattern) ✅
**Pattern:** Comprehensive research phase before architectural decisions  
**Benefit:** Prevents building on false assumptions

2. Design comprehensive research plan
3. Execute research with Truth Protocol
4. Validate assumptions with evidence
5. Only then create technical specifications

Benefits:
