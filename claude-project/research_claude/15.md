Cognitive Resonance and State Fidelity: An Evaluation Framework for Personal AI Operating Systems in Neurodivergent Contexts

1. Introduction: The Solopreneurial Paradox and the Agentic Shift
The contemporary digital economy has democratized the infrastructure of entrepreneurship, allowing the "solopreneur" to operate with the leverage of a corporation. However, this autonomy introduces a profound cognitive bottleneck: the individual must simultaneously function as the executive strategist and the operational laborer. For the neurodivergent solopreneur—specifically those presenting with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—this duality exacerbates core neurocognitive deficits in executive function, working memory, and emotional regulation.1 The resulting friction is not merely a matter of "productivity" in the industrial sense of output per hour; it is a crisis of fidelity—the alignment between high-level intent and moment-to-moment action.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet which exhibit high reasoning capabilities and large context windows, have enabled a shift from static Personal Information Management (PIM) tools to dynamic "Personal AI Life Operating Systems" (Life OS). These systems theoretically offer a solution to the "Wall of Awful"—the activation energy required to initiate tasks—and the pervasive "Time Blindness" that characterizes the ADHD experience.1 However, the efficacy of such systems remains largely anecdotal. Standard Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) metrics, such as task completion rates or time-on-task, are insufficient and often misleading in this context. A system that maximizes "time on task" might paradoxically be reinforcing hyperfocus on low-priority activities (productive procrastination), while a system that minimizes interaction time might fail to provide the necessary cognitive scaffolding to sustain long-term goals.4

This report presents a comprehensive, N=1 evaluation framework designed to measure the efficacy of a Claude-based Life OS. We introduce novel metrics tailored to neurophysiology: Interaction Friction (F), defined not just by clicks but by cognitive switching costs; State Drift (D), the divergence between the digital representation of tasks and physical reality; Recovery Kinetics (R), the system’s ability to detect and rectify executive dysfunction; and Cognitive Load (L), measuring the real-time demand on working memory. By synthesizing principles from machine learning "concept drift," IT "self-healing" systems, and clinical "N-of-1" trial designs, this framework provides a rigorous method for quantifying if and how a Personal AI OS improves the quality of life and economic output of an ADHD solopreneur.

1.1 The Neuroergonomics of ADHD in Digital Workspaces
To design a valid evaluation framework, one must first characterize the "user" not as a generic operator, but as a specific neurocognitive profile operating within a high-stakes, low-structure environment. The ADHD brain is characterized by a dysregulation of the dopamine reward system, leading to distinct challenges in the solopreneurial loop.

1.1.1 Executive Function as the Critical Bottleneck
Executive function (EF) encompasses the high-level cognitive processes required to plan, organize, initiate, and regulate behavior toward long-term goals. For the solopreneur, EF is the "engine" of business growth. In ADHD, this engine misfires in predictable ways.

Initiation Deficit: Often described as the "Wall of Awful," this is the emotional and energetic barrier to starting a task. It is not a lack of desire, but a failure of the brain's "ignition" system.1 A Life OS must therefore lower the activation energy for task entry.
Time Blindness and the Planning Fallacy: Individuals with ADHD perceive time non-linearly, leading to a chronic underestimation of task duration—a phenomenon known as the Planning Fallacy.3 This results in "schedule instability," where the planned day disintegrates within hours, leading to shame and abandonment of the planning tool.7
Working Memory Limits: The ADHD brain struggles to hold multiple constraints (e.g., "reply to client," "check invoice," "don't forget lunch") simultaneously. This leads to "state loss" during context switching, where the user enters a room or opens a tab and forgets their purpose.2
Emotional Dysregulation: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) and low frustration tolerance mean that minor technical setbacks or negative feedback can derail entire workdays.9

Current research suggests that these deficits are context-dependent. The "Load Theory" of attention indicates that ADHD performance deficits are magnified under high cognitive load (complex instructions) but can be minimized, or even reversed, under high perceptual load (visually rich, stimulating environments).4 This paradox suggests that a minimalist "zen" interface might actually be less effective for an ADHD user than a gamified, visually engaging one.10 A Personal AI Life OS must therefore act as a "cognitive prostheses," dynamically adjusting the load to keep the user in a zone of proximal development—neither bored (under-stimulated) nor overwhelmed (over-stimulated).

1.1.2 The Failure of Static Productivity Metrics
Traditional productivity frameworks rely on metrics like "items checked off" or "hours logged." In an ADHD context, these metrics are prone to "Task Rot" and "List Stagnation".5 A user may check off ten low-value tasks (dopamine seeking) while ignoring the one critical revenue-generating activity (avoidance). This "productive procrastination" registers as high productivity in standard metrics but represents a failure of executive prioritization. Furthermore, standard HCI metrics for "usability" often optimize for speed and friction reduction. However, for an ADHD user, frictionless entry can be detrimental if it enables impulsive distraction (e.g., one-click access to social media). Conversely, too much friction in capturing a thought leads to working memory failure. The evaluation framework must therefore measure Cognitive Resonance—the alignment between the user's mental state, the AI's contextual understanding, and the external reality.

2. Theoretical Framework and Core Metrics
The proposed framework moves beyond simple "usability" to measure "neuro-adaptive resonance." We propose four cardinal metrics: Friction (F), State Drift (D), Recovery (R), and Load (L). These metrics synthesize concepts from systems engineering (drift, self-healing) and cognitive psychology (load, regulation).

2.1 Metric F: Interaction Friction and Cognitive Tax
Friction is typically viewed as a negative attribute in User Interface (UI) design, something to be eliminated to streamline the user journey. However, in the context of designing for ADHD, the concept of friction requires a more nuanced definition. We must distinguish between Mechanical Friction (the number of clicks or keystrokes) and Cognitive Friction (the mental effort required to process information, make decisions, or switch contexts).

2.1.1 The Duality of Friction
Capture Friction (The Input Cost): This must be asymptotically close to zero. The "working memory" of an ADHD brain is volatile; if capturing a spontaneous thought or task takes more than a few seconds, the thought may be overwritten by a new stimulus.4 High capture friction leads to "open loops"—unrecorded tasks that drain cognitive resources.
Retrieval Friction (The Output Cost): This represents the effort required to get actionable context out of the system. Here, "less is more." A system that returns a "wall of text" or a complex dashboard increases Extraneous Cognitive Load, potentially causing "analysis paralysis" or immediate disengagement.11 The AI must curate information, presenting only what is relevant to the current context.

2.1.2 Measurement Methodology: SMEQ vs. NASA-TLX
To measure friction empirically in an N=1 study, we need a validated instrument. Two common scales are the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ).

NASA-TLX: This is a multi-dimensional scale measuring mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration.12 While comprehensive, it is intrusive (6 questions) and can interrupt the flow state we are trying to preserve.
SMEQ (Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire): This is a single-item scale ranging from 0 to 150, with verbal anchors like "Not at all hard to do" to "Tremendously hard to do".14 Research indicates that SMEQ correlates highly with NASA-TLX but is faster to administer and more sensitive to small variations in cognitive load.14

Recommendation: We utilize SMEQ for "micro-journaling" friction at the point of interaction. This provides high-resolution data on which specific interactions (e.g., "Add a task via voice" vs. "Add a task via typing") impose the highest cognitive tax.

2.2 Metric D: State Drift and Entropy
Borrowing from the domain of Machine Learning, specifically the concept of "Model Drift" or "Concept Drift" 16, we introduce State Drift as a primary metric for evaluating the fidelity of the Life OS.

2.2.1 Defining Drift in a Personal Context
In ML, drift occurs when the statistical properties of the target variable change over time, leading to model degradation. In PIM, State Drift is the divergence between the Digital State (the calendar, to-do list, project plan) and the Physical Reality (what the user is actually doing, has done, or is capable of doing).

The Entropy of Task Lists: In ADHD, the "entropy" of a to-do list increases naturally. Tasks are added impulsively but rarely deleted or completed, leading to a "task hoard." This accumulation creates a "Wall of Awful," where the list itself becomes a source of shame and is eventually ignored.5
Schedule Instability: This measures the volatility of the user's plan. High schedule instability—frequent rescheduling, missed deadlines, last-minute changes—is correlated with stress and reduced productivity.7

2.2.2 Quantifying Drift
We define Drift (D) mathematically as the magnitude of the difference between the planned vector (T_planned) and the actual vector (T_actual).

D = |T_planned - T_actual|

Concrete sub-metrics include:
Schedule Adherence Rate (SAR): Adapted from workforce management, this measures the percentage of time the user's activity matches the AI's proposed schedule.18

SAR = (Minutes in Adherence / Total Scheduled Minutes) × 100

Task Slippage: The ratio of tasks completed on their original due date versus those pushed to future dates.20
Intention-Behavior Gap: The discrepancy between what the user says they want to do (Intention) and what they actually do (Behavior).22 This is particularly relevant for "aspirational" tasks that never get done.

2.3 Metric R: Recovery Kinetics and Self-Healing
In Information Technology, "Self-Healing" systems are designed to detect faults (e.g., a crashed server) and automatically recover functionality without human intervention.24 We apply this concept to the human-AI loop. The "fault" in this context is an episode of executive dysfunction: distraction, hyperfocus on the wrong task, or an emotional spiral.

2.3.1 The Cycle of Drift and Recovery
The goal of the Life OS is not to prevent distraction entirely (which is impossible for the ADHD brain) but to shorten the duration of the distraction. This is the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).

Detection: The AI must first detect that the user has drifted. This requires "Context Awareness"—knowing that the user is on YouTube when they should be coding.24
Intervention: The AI must then intervene. This intervention is a "Nudge."
Resolution: The user returns to the target task.

2.3.2 Measuring Efficacy
Nudge Success Rate (NSR): The percentage of AI interventions that result in the user returning to the target task within a specified window (e.g., 5 minutes).26
Recovery Velocity: How quickly does the user transition from "distracted" to "productive" after a nudge?
Self-Healing Efficiency: Does the system learn which nudges work? (e.g., "gentle reminder" vs. "audio alarm").

2.4 Metric L: Cognitive Load and Reserve
Cognitive Load Theory posits that human working memory is limited. For ADHD users, this limit is often lower, or more easily overwhelmed by extraneous stimuli. However, a unique feature of ADHD is that under-load (boredom) is as detrimental as overload.4

2.4.1 The Goldilocks Zone
The Life OS must manage the user's cognitive load to keep them in the "Goldilocks Zone" of engagement.
Overload indicators: High error rates, frustration, abandonment of the task.
Under-load indicators: Seeking distractions, "zoning out," fidgeting.

2.4.2 Measurement Proxies
Reaction Time Variability (RTV): In ADHD, high variability in reaction time is a robust marker of attentional lapses.4 In a chat-based Life OS, we can measure the variability in the time it takes the user to respond to AI prompts. High RTV suggests the user is struggling to maintain focus.
Linguistic Complexity: By analyzing the user's text input, we can infer cognitive state. A drop in sentence complexity, an increase in typos, or a shift to monosyllabic answers can signal "Brain Rot" or cognitive fatigue.
Single Ease Question (SEQ): A post-task question ("How difficult was this?") that provides a subjective measure of load.27

3. Experimental Design: The N=1 Trial
Given the extreme heterogeneity of ADHD symptoms—where one user may struggle with initiation while another struggles with hyperfocus—a traditional Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is ill-suited for evaluating a personalized Life OS. Instead, we employ a Single-Case Experimental Design (SCED), specifically the N-of-1 trial.28 This rigorous, data-driven approach treats the individual user as the sole unit of observation, allowing for the optimization of the intervention to their specific neurobiology.

3.1 Design Topology: The ABAB Reversal
To establish a causal relationship between the AI Life OS and the user's performance, we utilize an ABAB Reversal Design.30 This design alternates between baseline conditions (A) and intervention conditions (B) to demonstrate that changes in the dependent variables (Friction, Drift, Recovery, Load) are functionally related to the introduction and withdrawal of the AI system.

Table 1: ABAB Experiment Schedule
Phase | Duration | Condition | Description | Telemetry
A1 | 7 Days | Baseline | User utilizes existing tool stack (e.g., G-Cal, Todoist, Paper). No AI assistance. | Passive Only (Screen time, app usage).
B1 | 14 Days | Intervention | Claude-based Life OS activated. Active nudging, planning, and body-doubling. | Full Active & Passive Logging.
A2 | 7 Days | Withdrawal | AI deactivated. User returns to baseline tools. Measures skill transfer vs. dependency. | Passive Only.
B2 | 14 Days | Reintroduction | AI Reactivated with tuned parameters based on B1 data. | Full Active & Passive Logging.

Rationale for Duration:
Phase A1 (7 Days): Sufficient to establish a representative baseline of the user's "natural" state, including weekend variances.
Phase B1 (14 Days): ADHD users often experience a "novelty effect" where any new tool works for a few days due to dopamine release.32 A 14-day period is necessary to control for this novelty and observe the system's performance once the initial excitement fades.
Phase A2 (7 Days): Withdrawal allows us to see if the positive effects persist (learning) or collapse (dependency). It also controls for external factors (e.g., did the user just have a good month?).
Phase B2 (14 Days): Confirms the efficacy of the intervention and allows for "hyper-parameter tuning" of the AI's personality and intervention thresholds.

3.2 Hypothesis Generation
The evaluation is guided by four specific hypotheses derived from the core metrics:
H1 (Friction): The AI OS will reduce the Subjective Mental Effort (SMEQ) of task capture and retrieval by >40% compared to baseline methods.
H2 (Drift): Schedule Adherence Rate (SAR) will improve by >25% in Phase B compared to Phase A, and the Task Rot Rate (age of uncompleted tasks) will decrease.
H3 (Recovery): The Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) from detected distractions will be significantly shorter (p < .05 via Tau-U analysis) in Phase B due to active AI nudging.
H4 (Load): Subjective Cognitive Load (SEQ) at the end of the workday will be lower in Phase B, even if total task output increases, indicating higher neural efficiency.

3.3 The "Solopreneur" Scenario Simulation
To ensure ecological validity, the experiment must track real-world solopreneurial activities. We categorize these into three "Task Modes," each with different risks and cognitive profiles:
Deep Work (High Load, High Risk): Coding, writing, strategic planning. Risk: Hyperfocus (losing track of time) or Avoidance (Wall of Awful).
Admin Churn (Low Load, High Drift): Email, invoicing, scheduling. Risk: "Productive Procrastination" and drifting into social media.5
Creative Ideation (High Perceptual Load): Brainstorming, design. Risk: Tangential thinking and loss of original goal.

3.4 Handling Bias and Validity
Blinding: It is impossible to blind the user to the intervention (they know they are using an AI). However, we can blind the analysis by having an automated script process the logs without the user's manual interference.28
The Novelty Effect: As noted, the 14-day duration of Phase B helps mitigate this. We also track usage intensity—if interaction drops off after day 4, it suggests the system relies on novelty rather than utility.

4. The Claude-Based 'Life OS' Architecture
The intervention system utilizes Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet via API, integrated into a local environment (e.g., a Python script wrapping Obsidian, Notion, or a dedicated local chat interface). This local-first approach is critical for data privacy and ensures the "persona" of the AI remains stable and accessible even without a browser.

4.1 Persona Drift and System Prompting
Large Language Models, including Claude, suffer from "Persona Drift" or "Attention Decay" over long context windows.33 In a multi-turn conversation spanning weeks, the model may "forget" its specific instructions to be a concise, non-judgmental accountability partner and revert to a generic "helpful assistant" persona.

The Risk: A generic assistant might provide long, verbose answers that increase cognitive load. A "Life OS" must be terse and directive when necessary.

Mitigation Strategy:
Split-Softmax/Context Refresh: Regularly summarizing the conversation state and re-injecting the system prompt.33
System Prompt Structure: The prompt must define the AI not just as a tool, but as a "Co-Regulator".
Role: "You are an executive function prosthesis for an ADHD solopreneur."
Directive: "Prioritize state fidelity. If the user deviates from the plan, gently inquire. Do not judge. Use short, actionable sentences."

4.2 Context Schema and Memory
To minimize user cognitive load, the AI must maintain a structured "memory" of the user's state. If the user has to remind the AI "I am working on Project X," the friction is too high. We utilize a tiered memory architecture stored in a JSON-based stream.34

Table 2: Agent Memory Schema Strategy
Memory Tier | Data Stored | Refresh Rate | Purpose
Short-Term (Working) | Current active window title, last 5 user messages, current timer status, "Drift" status. | Real-time (<10s) | Immediate context awareness for nudging. "Are you still coding?"
Episodic (Journal) | Summary of yesterday's achievements, current active project goals, "Wins" and "Blockers." | Daily | Continuity across sessions; preventing "blank slate" anxiety.
Semantic (User Model) | User preferences (e.g., "I hate phone calls in the morning"), recurring anxieties, coping mechanisms that work. | Weekly update | Personalization and trust building.
Procedural (SOPs) | Standard Operating Procedures for specific tasks (e.g., "Invoicing workflow steps"). | Static (User edited) | Reducing decision fatigue during routine tasks.

4.3 Adjustable Autonomy Framework
The system must not be static. It should employ Adjustable Autonomy, dynamically shifting its level of intervention based on the user's estimated cognitive state.35

Level 1 (Passive/Manual): The AI waits for commands. This is appropriate during "Deep Work" or "Flow States" where interruption would be detrimental.
Level 2 (Scaffolding/Augmented): The AI suggests next steps based on previous context. "You just finished the draft. Should I start the editing checklist?"
Level 3 (Interventionist/Autonomous): The AI actively interrupts (audio/visual) if State Drift exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., 20 minutes on social media during a "Deep Work" block). It essentially "takes the wheel" to guide the user back.35

5. Logging Templates and Data Collection
Accurate measurement requires robust logging. We employ a dual-logging strategy: Passive Telemetry (automated data collection) and Active Sampling (user input). The data schema is designed to be machine-readable (JSON) for automated analysis while capturing the nuance of human behavior.

5.1 JSON Telemetry Schema
To capture Interaction Friction and State Drift, the system logs events in a structured JSON format. This schema is inspired by best practices in log management and agent memory design.34

JSON
{
  "event_id": "evt_00123456",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T14:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "interaction",
  "session_id": "sess_98765",
  "context": {
    "active_app": "VS Code",
    "scheduled_task": "Develop API Endpoint",
    "drift_status": "ALIGNED",
    "time_in_state_sec": 1200
  },
  "metrics": {
    "response_latency_ms": 450,
    "input_token_count": 150,
    "output_token_count": 50,
    "user_sentiment_score": 0.8,
    "typing_variability_index": 1.2
  },
  "intervention": {
    "nudge_triggered": false,
    "nudge_type": null,
    "nudge_response_time_sec": null
  }
}

Key Fields for Analysis:
drift_status: A calculated field comparing active_app (from OS telemetry) to scheduled_task (from the AI's plan). Values: ALIGNED, DRIFTING, UNKNOWN.
typing_variability_index: A proxy for cognitive load/fatigue, calculated from keystroke dynamics.4
user_sentiment_score: NLP analysis of the user's text, useful for detecting frustration (RSD).9

5.2 Active Sampling: The "Micro-Journal"
To measure subjective Cognitive Load (SMEQ/SEQ) without inducing "tracking fatigue", we use a command-line or chat-based "micro-journal" prompted only at task transitions or when drift is detected.39

Prompt: "Transition detected. Rate friction (0-150) and energy (1-7)."

Data Structure:
JSON
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T15:00:00Z",
  "task_transition": "API Dev -> Email",
  "SMEQ_score": 30,
  "SEQ_score": 6,
  "emotional_state": "bored",
  "perceived_drift": "low"
}

5.3 Mitigating Tracking Fatigue
ADHD users often abandon tracking tools because the tracking itself becomes a chore—a phenomenon known as "Tracking Fatigue".39
Passive-First Strategy: We rely on screen time APIs (e.g., ActivityWatch, RescueTime) for 90% of the data. The user should not have to manually log "I am working."
Gamification: We implement "streaks" and visual rewards for completing the end-of-day log.10 The interface should be visually responsive (e.g., turning green when the log is done) to provide an immediate dopamine hit.32

6. Concrete Evaluation Framework: The Metrics in Action
This section details the specific formulas and methodologies for calculating the four core metrics during the experiment.

6.1 Measuring Friction (F)
We utilize a composite score of Time-to-Capture and Decision Steps.

Formula:
F = (T_input × W_effort) + C_steps

T_input: Time in seconds from "intention" (hotkey press) to "capture complete."
W_effort: Weighting factor (1.0 for voice, 1.5 for typing, 2.0 for navigating menus/GUI).
C_steps: Number of distinct UI interactions (clicks/taps) required.

Analysis: We compare the mean F in Phase A (Baseline) vs. Phase B (AI).
Hypothesis: F_AI < 0.5 × F_Baseline. The AI's natural language understanding should eliminate the need for navigating menus or categorizing tasks manually.

6.2 Measuring State Drift (D)
This is the critical metric for addressing "Time Blindness" and "Task Rot."

Schedule Adherence Rate (SAR):18
SAR = (Minutes in Adherence / Total Scheduled Minutes) × 100

Adherence Definition: User activity matches the semantic category of the scheduled block (e.g., VS Code matches Coding).

Drift Velocity (V_drift): The rate at which the schedule slips. If a 1-hour task turns into 3 hours, the drift velocity is high.
V_drift = (ΔT_actual - ΔT_planned) / ΔT_planned

Analysis: High Drift Velocity in Phase A vs. Low in Phase B indicates the AI is successfully "anchoring" the user in time.

6.3 Measuring Recovery (R)
We adapt the "Self-Healing" concept.24
Detection Accuracy: Can the AI correctly identify that the user is "doomscrolling" vs. "researching"? This requires training a simple classifier on window titles/URLs or using the LLM's reasoning capabilities on the active window context.

Nudge Success Rate (NSR):
NSR = Successful Re-engagements / Total Nudges Triggered

Successful Re-engagement: User returns to the scheduled app within 2 minutes of the nudge.

Mean Time to Refocus (MTTR):
MTTR = T_resumed - T_distraction_start

Lower MTTR indicates that the AI's intervention (or the user's self-regulation) is effective.

6.4 Measuring Cognitive Load (L)
Reaction Time Variability (RTV):4
In the chat interface, we measure the standard deviation of user typing speed or response latency to AI questions. High RTV is a biomarker for ADHD attentional lapses and cognitive fatigue.

Linguistic Complexity: We analyze the user's input for lexical diversity and sentence length. A significant drop correlates with cognitive depletion.
Subjective Load: The daily average of SMEQ scores.

7. Adaptation Recommendations: The Closed-Loop System
A "Life OS" is not a passive tool; it is an active agent. Based on the real-time evaluation of the metrics above, the system should adapt its behavior. This creates a "Closed-Loop" neuro-adaptive system.40

7.1 Dynamic Friction Adjustment
Trigger: User logs high Friction/Fatigue in the evening (SMEQ > 100) or linguistic complexity drops.
Adaptation: The AI switches from text-based interaction to Voice-Only Input to lower the barrier to entry. It simplifies prompts (e.g., from "What is the detailed plan for tomorrow?" to "Just tell me one thing you want to do.").

7.2 Counter-Drift Nudging (Body Doubling)
Trigger: Drift Velocity is increasing (user is consistently >15 mins late) or SAR drops below 70%.
Adaptation: The AI initiates "Body Doubling Mode". It changes its interaction style from "Assistant" to "Peer."
Action: It asks for check-ins every 5-10 minutes.
Prompt: "I'm here with you. Let's just write the first sentence. Tell me when it's done."
Mechanism: This leverages the "social pressure" aspect of body doubling to bypass the initiation deficit.

7.3 Load Balancing and Triage
Trigger: High RTV and indications of Overwhelm (e.g., user ignores notifications).
Adaptation: The AI enters "Triage Mode."
Action: It hides the full to-do list, which is a source of anxiety.
Presentation: It presents only the single most critical task.
Rationale: This reduces Visual and Extraneous Cognitive Load, helping the user focus on the immediate step rather than the "Wall of Awful".42

7.4 Gamification Elements
To sustain engagement, the system should employ gamification mechanics that appeal to the ADHD brain's need for novelty and reward.10
Streaks: Visual counters for days of consistent logging.
Experience Points (XP): Awarded for low-drift days or quick recovery from distraction.
Visual Themes: The interface changes based on the "Task Mode" (e.g., a "Deep Space" theme for Deep Work), utilizing perceptual load theory to enhance focus.4

8. Analysis Plan and Reporting

8.1 Visual Analysis
For N=1 trials, visual inspection of time-series graphs is the primary method of analysis.30
Graph 1: The Drift Chart. A line graph showing Planned vs. Actual cumulative hours over the 4-week period. In Phase B (AI), the lines should converge, indicating higher fidelity.
Graph 2: The Friction Heatmap. Day of week vs. Time of day, colored by subjective SMEQ scores. This identifies "Friction Hotspots" (e.g., Monday mornings) where the AI needs to be most active.

8.2 Statistical Checks
While N=1 precludes population-level statistics, we can use specific non-parametric tests:
Tau-U: A statistic for analyzing single-case data that controls for baseline trends. It provides a measure of the "non-overlap" between phases.30
Effect Size: Calculating the Standard Mean Difference (SMD) between Phase A and Phase B for metrics like MTTR and SAR.

8.3 Qualitative Synthesis
We combine the quantitative logs with the "Micro-Journal" entries to understand the quality of the experience.
Insight: Does low Drift correspond to high Satisfaction? Or does strict adherence cause "Rebellion" (psychological reactance) where the user fights the system?43
Adjustment: If reactance is high, the AI's "tone" parameter needs to be adjusted from "Manager" (directive) to "Peer" (suggestive).

9. Conclusion
The "Personal AI Life OS" represents a potential paradigm shift for the ADHD solopreneur, moving from passive tools that require energy to maintain, to active agents that supply energy and structure. However, the promise of such systems can only be validated through rigorous, neuro-informed measurement.

This framework shifts the evaluation focus from "Productivity" (output per hour) to "Fidelity" (alignment of intent and action). By instrumenting Friction, State Drift, Recovery, and Cognitive Load, we can tune the AI not just to make the user work more, but to work better, with less cognitive cost. The ultimate goal is a system that acts as a reliable, externalized executive function—a digital prefrontal cortex—dampening the noise of the world so the neurodivergent mind can tune into its signal.
