feat(meta): Bootstrap Memory Bank for project continuity

Created lightweight Memory Bank to enable new Claude chats to load context
quickly without reading old chat history.

Files Created:
- memory-bank/project-brief.md
  * Project overview (Vision, Requirements, Constraints)
  * TL;DR (20-second version) for quick understanding
  * Maintenance rule: Update only when vision/scope changes (rare)

- memory-bank/01-active-context.md
  * Current state (Focus, Recent Changes, Next Steps)
  * Quick Status (3-line, 10-second version)
  * Protocol for using Memory Bank at chat start/end
  * Maintenance rule: Update after EVERY completed slice

- memory-bank/02-progress.md
  * Chronological log of completed slices
  * Format: "- YYYY-MM-DD – Slice X.Y: Brief description"

Protocol for Future Chats:
AT START:
1. Read project-brief.md + 01-active-context.md
2. Summarize for user (project, phase, recent work, next options)
3. THEN start working on requested slice

AT END:
1. Update 01-active-context.md (Current Focus, Recent Changes, Next Steps)
2. Append to 02-progress.md (date + slice + description)

ADHD-Friendly Design:
- Multiple entry points: 10 sec (Quick Status) / 20 sec (TL;DR) / 5 min (full brief)
- Short, scannable, bullet-based
- No need to read chat history
- Clear "where am I, what's next" in <30 seconds

Research Alignment:
- Memory Bank pattern (Memory/RAG research family)
- Truth Layer principle (files as source of truth, not chat history)
- ADHD-aware design (cognitive offloading, low friction)
- Chat → Spec → Change (load context first, then work)

Updated:
- claude project/system_mapping/migration_plan.md
  * Added "Meta-Slice: Memory Bank Bootstrap" after Slice 1.2b
  * Documented purpose, protocol, research alignment

Type: Infrastructure (meta-slice, not in original migration plan)
Benefit: Project continuity across Claude chat sessions
Duration: ~45 min
Risk: None (additive only)
