# PHASE_PROGRESS_MAP.md — Updated with System Story Context

## 📅 Date: 2025‑11‑25
**Owner:** Or’s AI‑OS Core Team

## 🎯 Purpose
This file tracks the evolution of Or’s AI‑OS through its phases **and now includes the story and purpose behind the route** — to keep the system emotionally and strategically aligned with its creator’s intent.

---

## 🧭 The Story — Why This System Exists
Or’s AI‑OS was never meant to be just a technical project.  
It is the gradual construction of a living, transparent infrastructure — one that Or can truly understand, control, and evolve through dialogue rather than technical actions.

When the process began, many automations were scattered and running beyond Or’s awareness: Google scripts, Make scenarios, Telegram bots, and local PowerShell commands.  
The goal of this route is to **reclaim control**, re‑architect all these flows, and design an ecosystem that Or governs intuitively.

The purpose of each phase is to turn confusion into clarity — until Or no longer has to “run” anything, only guide.

## ⚙️ Summary of Current Mission
1. **Rebuild the foundations (Route Recalculation & Core Infra):** done through Phases 1–2.3.
2. **Give Claude and GPT equal capabilities:** remove hierarchy, define clear strength‑based delegation.
3. **Stabilize every active channel:** GitHub, Google, Chat1, Make.
4. **Transform temporary scripts (PowerShell, local commands) into reliable services.**
5. **Map and reclaim all hidden Google automations** — then reintegrate them safely.
6. **Prepare Claude to handle all service integrations (GPTs, Make, Chat1) in a professional, durable way.**

## 💫 Guiding Principle
> “Technology should never outpace understanding.  
> We build not to automate Or — we build so Or can breathe.”
