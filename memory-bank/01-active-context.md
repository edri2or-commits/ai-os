?? **NEW CLAUDE INSTANCE? READ THIS FIRST!** ??

**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING:**

If you're a new Claude instance (new chat in this project), you MUST:

1. **Read START_HERE.md** ? Entry point for new instances
2. **Read memory-bank/project-brief.md** ? What is this project?
3. **Read THIS FILE completely** ? Where are we now?
4. **Read revolution-research/RESEARCH_INDEX.md** ? 13 research reports overview
5. **Read revolution-research/REVOLUTION_INTEGRATION.md** ? How research maps to 5 Layers

Then:

**CHECKLIST (check mentally before starting work):**
- [ ] I read START_HERE.md
- [ ] I read project-brief.md (vision)
- [ ] I read "Current Focus" section below (which Phase/Slice)
- [ ] I read "Recent Changes" section (what happened recently)
- [ ] I read "Next Steps" section (proposed options)
- [ ] I read RESEARCH_INDEX.md (13 reports overview)
- [ ] I read REVOLUTION_INTEGRATION.md (research → 5 Layers mapping)
- [ ] I summarized to user: Phase, %, recent work, 2-3 next options
- [ ] I waited for user to choose direction
- [ ] User confirmed before I started executing

?? **DO NOT SKIP THIS** - prevents drift, duplication, confusion!

PROTOCOL: How to use Memory Bank files in this project

AT START OF ANY NEW CHAT:
1. Read these files:
   - memory-bank/project-brief.md (project overview)
   - memory-bank/01-active-context.md (THIS FILE - where we are now)

2. Summarize for user:
   - What this project is (1-2 sentences from project-brief.md)
   - Which Phase/Slice we are in (from Current Focus below)
   - What changed recently (from Recent Changes below)
   - What you propose as next 1-3 slices (from Next Steps below)

3. THEN start working on requested slice

AT END OF ANY MEANINGFUL SLICE:
1. Update THIS FILE (01-active-context.md):
   - Update "Current Focus" with new Phase/Slice
   - Move completed slice from "Next Steps" to "Recent Changes"
   - Add new candidates to "Next Steps" from migration_plan.md

2. Append to 02-progress.md:
   - Format: "- YYYY-MM-DD � Slice X.Y: Brief description"

3. Keep both files SHORT and SCANNABLE (ADHD-friendly)

POST-SLICE REFLECTION (Protocol 1 - Auto-Run):
After EVERY slice (completed or interrupted), Claude MUST automatically:
1. Update Memory Bank (01-active-context.md + 02-progress.md)
2. Update Side Architect Bridge (if major milestone: ?5% progress, new infrastructure, architectural decision)
   - Note: Reconciler (design + implementation) qualifies as key infrastructure for Trigger G
3. Detect Meta-Learning Triggers (Playbook Section 9):
   - Repetition (2nd+ occurrence) ? propose AP-XXX
   - Workaround used ? propose TD-XXX
   - User surprise ? check spec clarity
   - Research gap (3+ "not sure") ? propose research slice
   - Friction point ? propose automation
   - Major milestone reached ? update bridge (Trigger G)
4. If incident detected, run Incident Response Protocol (Playbook Section 8)
5. Propose documentation updates (don't wait for user to ask)
6. Git commit all changes

See Playbook Section 15 for full checklist.

SIDE-ARCHITECT ASSISTANT MANAGEMENT:
When the side-architect role or onboarding flow materially changes, Claude Desktop MUST propose synchronized updates to:
1. `memory-bank/docs/side-architect-bridge.md` (current state snapshot)
2. `memory-bank/docs/side-architect-onboarding.md` (instruction block + opening template + checklist)
3. `memory-bank/README.md` ("For Side Architect Assistants" section)

Examples of material changes:
- New sections added to bridge or digest
- Role boundaries change (new capabilities or restrictions)
- New files become canonical sources of truth
- Onboarding protocol changes (e.g., new required files)

For starting a new side-architect assistant chat, always refer user to `memory-bank/docs/side-architect-onboarding.md` as the canonical onboarding flow.

GROUNDING:
- This pattern follows Memory Bank research family
- Truth Layer principle: Files are memory, not chat history
- ADHD principle: Quick context load, minimal cognitive overhead

- Goal: End-to-end integration test (Email Watcher → Observer → Reconciler) + Telegram notifications
- Problem: Email Watcher and Reconciler used different drift directories (not connected)
- Solution: Unified drift directory (truth-layer/drift/) + added Telegram alert system
- Architecture Decision: Information + Alerts pattern (not full automation)
  - Email drift reports = documentation (YAML files)
  - High-priority emails → Telegram alerts (immediate notification)
  - User decides manually (open Gmail, take action)
  - Deferred: Reconciler CRs with Gmail API automation (Phase 2)
- Changes Made:
  - Email Watcher: Changed DRIFT_DIR from memory-bank/drift/ to truth-layer/drift/
  - Reconciler: Changed DRIFT_REPORTS_DIR from docs/system_state/drift/ to truth-layer/drift/

    - Added send_telegram_alert() method (78 lines)
    - Filter logic: high priority OR (medium + action_needed)
    - Alert format: category emoji 💼📋👤, priority, subject (60 chars), from, suggested_action
    - Limit: 5 emails per alert (prevents spam)
    - Configuration: TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=5786217215 in .env
  - OAuth Fix: Resolved 401 error with google_oauth_refresh_tokens MCP tool
- Integration Testing Results:
  - ✅ Email Watcher saves to truth-layer/drift/ (email-drift-*.yaml)
  - ✅ Reconciler reads from truth-layer/drift/ (path fixed)
  - ✅ Observer detects drift in truth-layer/ (Life Graph changes)
  - ✅ End-to-end flow validated: Email Watcher → drift reports → Reconciler can read
  - ✅ Telegram alert sent: 5 urgent emails (4 MEDIUM + 1 HIGH)
    - HIGH: Gmail storage full (28 days warning) 🚨
    - MEDIUM: Link verification, n8n license, Google Play payment, Base44 invitation
- Files Modified:
  - tools/email_watcher.py (+75 lines: Telegram integration)
  - tools/reconciler.py (+1 line: DRIFT_REPORTS_DIR path fix)

- Goal: Fix drift in side-architect-bridge.md (metadata outdated after 2.4b)
- Solution: 4 surgical edits (YAML frontmatter, Recent Slices, Current Work, new subsection)
- Changes: current_slice (2.4a → 2.4b), progress_pct (27 → 30), "What Side Architects Do/Don't Do" section
- Result: Bridge reflects actual state (2.4b, 30%), side architects understand boundaries
- Duration: ~25 min | Risk: NONE (documentation only)

**2025-12-01 - Slice 2.4b: Reconciler Implementation (CR Management)** ⭐ COMPLETED
- Goal: Implement CR lifecycle management (generate/list/approve/reject, zero entity mods)
- Solution: Built reconciler.py (680 lines) with drift parsing, CR generation, HITL workflows
- Result: ✅ Drift parsing, ✅ CR auto-ID, ✅ CLI 5 commands, ❌ NO apply logic (deferred to 2.4c)
- Duration: ~1.5 hours | Risk: NONE (zero entity modifications)

**2025-12-01 - Micro-Slice: Documentation Sync (Post-2.4a)** ✅ COMPLETED
- Trigger: Protocol 1 + Trigger G (Reconciler design = key infrastructure)
- Goal: Update documentation files to reflect completion of Slice 2.4a
- Changes: Updated bridge.md, START_HERE.md, 01-active-context.md
- Result: All documentation consistent and up-to-date
- Duration: ~15 min | Risk: NONE (documentation only)



# Session Summary (2025-11-30 - Extended)

**Today's Major Achievement:** Meta-Learning Infrastructure + Life Graph Schema Completion

**What We Built:**
1. ? **Reflexive Protocol Layer** (Micro-Slice 2.2c.0)
   - Playbook v0.2 with autonomous improvement capabilities
   - AP-001 (Context Window Overflow prevention)
   - Incident Response Protocol (5-step analysis)
   - Meta-Learning Triggers (5 types for pattern detection)
   - Protocol 1 (Post-Slice Reflection auto-runs)
   
2. ? **Life Graph Schema Complete** (Slice 2.2c)
   - 6/6 entities: Area, Project, Task, Context, Identity, Log
   - All templates + JSON schemas
   - LIFE_GRAPH_SCHEMA.md v1.1 (surgical edits per AP-001)
   - Validator infrastructure (requirements.txt)

**Phase 2 Progress:** 10% ? 15% (3/~12 slices done)

**System Capabilities Added:**
- ? Claude detects meta-learning triggers automatically
- ? Claude proposes documentation without being asked
- ? Claude updates Memory Bank automatically (Protocol 1)
- ? AP-001 prevents context overflow on large files
- ? Incident Response Protocol operational

**Incidents Resolved:**
- Context window overflow (2025-11-30) ? AP-001 created + validated

**Technical Debt:**
- TD-001: Git MCP not configured (workaround: manual PowerShell bridge - working)

**Repository State:**
- ? Life Graph schema complete (6 entities)
- ? Meta-learning infrastructure operational
- ? Memory Bank updated
- ? All changes committed to git

# Next Steps

**VALIDATION SPRINT HANDOFF DOCUMENT CREATED:**
- **File:** `memory-bank/docs/VALIDATION_SPRINT_HANDOFF.md` (~292 lines)
- **Purpose:** Complete context for next Claude instance working on validation
- **Contains:**
  - Completed work (VAL-7 + VAL-4) with test results
  - Remaining sprint items (VAL-1b, VAL-1, VAL-6, VAL-8, VAL-9)
  - Available tools (Desktop Commander, Google MCP, etc.)
  - Recommended approaches (3 options: Quick Win, Security-First, ADHD-Optimized)
  - Key files to know about
  - Success criteria (95% empirical confidence target)

**READ HANDOFF DOC FIRST before starting validation work!**

---

**Immediate Candidates:**

**Option A: Slice 2.2b � Field Standardization + Validator Enhancement (1-2 hours)**
- Problem: Inconsistent field names (`dopamine_level` vs `dopamine_reward`, `scheduled` vs `do_date`)
- Action: 
  - Standardize to canonical names across all templates
  - Enhance validator with better error messages
  - Migration guide for existing entities
- Risk: Low (templates only, no live data yet)
- Benefit: Clean, consistent schema before users create entities

**Option B: Infrastructure � Configure Git MCP (TD-001) (1-2 hours)**
- Problem: Git MCP server not configured ? manual git bridges required
- Action: Install mcp-server-git, configure in claude_desktop_config.json, test
- Risk: Medium (requires config + Claude Desktop restart)
- Benefit: Full autonomy for git operations, removes friction

**Option C: Slice 2.3a � Observer (Read-Only Drift Detection)**
- Now that Life Graph schema is complete, could start Observer development
- Observer reads Truth Layer + detects drift
- Read-only, safe to experiment
- Foundation for Reconciler

**Infrastructure Note:** Side Architect Bridge created (2025-12-01)
- `docs/side-architect-bridge.md` provides quick state snapshot for side architect
- `docs/side-architect-research-digest.md` summarizes architecture + research families
- Reduces friction for side architect assistant onboarding (~10 min context load vs re-reading all research)

**Strategic Note:**
- Life Graph schema complete (6/6 entities) ?
- Meta-learning infrastructure operational (Playbook v0.2, AP-001, Protocol 1) ?
- Ready for either:
  - Polish schema (2.2b) before users create entities, OR
  - Move to Observer/Reconciler (core functionality)

**User Preference:**
- ADHD-aware: prefer momentum + quick wins
- Safety-first: always reversible changes
- Autonomous improvement: Claude detects patterns + proposes fixes

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-30 (after Slice 1.4)  
**Next Update:** After next completed slice
