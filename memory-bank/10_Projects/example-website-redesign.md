# Website Redesign Project

## Goal
Launch redesigned personal website with portfolio section by end of January 2026

## Why Now
Current site is outdated (last updated 2022). Need professional portfolio for freelance opportunities.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Research design inspiration (30 min, @laptop, low_energy OK)
- [ ] Sketch wireframes for 3 key pages (60 min, @laptop, creative)
- [ ] Choose color palette and typography (20 min, @laptop, admin)

## Resources
- [Awwwards inspiration](https://www.awwwards.com)
- Current site repo: github.com/username/old-site

## Notes
- Prioritize portfolio section (showcase 5-7 best projects)
- Keep design minimal and fast-loading
- Consider adding blog section (nice-to-have, not MVP)

- 2025-11-30: Project created, initial brainstorming
