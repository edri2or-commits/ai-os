# START HERE - AI Life OS Entry Point

**If you are a new AI instance, this is your navigation hub.**

---

## 🤖 For External LLMs (GPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.)

**🎯 START HERE:** Read [`/SYSTEM_BOOK.md`](../SYSTEM_BOOK.md) first.

**What it contains:**
- Quick Context Injection (< 500 tokens) - Get productive in 30 seconds
- Progressive disclosure - Links to everything you need
- How to use guide - Tailored for external LLMs
- Live system state - What's operational right now

**Why SYSTEM_BOOK.md and not this file?**
- SYSTEM_BOOK = LLM-optimized (llms.txt standard, token-efficient)
- START_HERE = Deep navigation within Memory Bank (for context loading)

**After reading SYSTEM_BOOK, come back here if you need deep dives.**

## 📍 For Claude (This Project Session)

**You already have full context via Project Knowledge.**

Follow the standard onboarding below to load current state:

---

## ?? If You're Lost: Start Here

**Feeling confused about WHY this system exists? Lost in technical details?**

?? **Read FIRST:** `memory-bank/00_The_Sovereign_AI_Manifesto.md`

This is your **"North Star"** - it explains:
- WHY AI Life OS exists (it's a Prosthetic Executive Cortex for ADHD)
- 4 Core Principles (Cognitive Sovereignty, Attention Defense, Executive Prosthesis, The Gardener)
- Journey Map connecting to all other documentation
- ADHD-specific justifications for every architectural choice

**When to read it:**
- First time in this project ? Read it
- User says "������ �����" (lost control) ? Point them to Manifesto
- Confused about WHY a decision was made ? Check Manifesto principles
- Need to explain the system to someone ? Start with Manifesto

**Then proceed with normal onboarding:**

---

## Quick Context Load (< 2 minutes)

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Read Project Brief
?? **File:** `memory-bank/project-brief.md`

**What you'll learn:**
- Vision: What is AI Life OS?
- Why does it exist?
- TL;DR summary (20 seconds)

---

### Step 2: Read Current Active Context ? MOST IMPORTANT
?? **File:** `memory-bank/01-active-context.md`

**What you'll learn:**
- Current Phase and % completion
- Recent changes (last 5-8 slices)
- Next steps (2-3 proposed options)
- **This is your ground truth!**

---

### Step 3: 🏛️ Understand the Architecture (NEW - CRITICAL)
📐 **Files:** `memory-bank/docs/` (Architecture Foundation)

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AI INSTANCES:**

**Read FIRST (in order):**
1. **`docs/decisions/ADR-001-architectural-alignment.md`**
   - THE canonical architecture decision
   - Hexagonal (primary) + MAPE-K (secondary)
   - What we rejected and why ("Semantic Microkernel", "QAL Machine")

2. **`docs/CANONICAL_TERMINOLOGY.md`**
   - ONLY authoritative source for system terms
   - Use ONLY these terms in all communication
   - Forbidden terms list (violations = ADR breach)

3. **`docs/METAPHOR_GUIDE.md`**
   - When to use which metaphor (Hexagonal/Cognitive/LLM-OS)
   - Decision matrix for technical vs human communication

**Read when needed:**
4. **`docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md`**
   - Detailed technical guide (300+ lines)
   - Component mapping, data flow examples
   - Anti-patterns

**Why this matters:**
- Without reading these, you'll use **deprecated terms** (e.g., `"The Brain"` instead of **"Application Core"**)
- All architectural decisions MUST reference ADR-001
- This prevents drift back to inconsistent terminology

**Time:** 10 minutes (ADR-001 + Terminology) = mandatory  
**Time:** 5 minutes (Metaphor Guide) = recommended  
**Time:** 15 minutes (Architecture Reference) = as-needed

---

### Step 4: (Optional) Read Full History
?? **File:** `memory-bank/02-progress.md`

**Only if you need:**
- Full chronological history of all slices
- Detailed context from previous work

**Most of the time, Steps 1-2 are enough to start working!**

---

### Step 5: (Special Context) Active Work Handoffs
?? **If working on specific subsystems, check for handoff docs:**

**Validation Sprint:**
- **File:** `memory-bank/docs/VALIDATION_SPRINT_HANDOFF.md`
- **When to read:** If continuing validation work (VAL-* slices)
- **Contains:** 
  - Completed work (VAL-7, VAL-4) with test results
  - Remaining items (VAL-1b, VAL-1, VAL-6, VAL-8, VAL-9)
  - Tool setup instructions (MCP Inspector, pytest, etc.)
  - 3 recommended approaches (Quick Win, Security-First, ADHD-Optimized)
  - Success criteria (95% empirical confidence target)

**Other handoff docs:** Check `memory-bank/docs/` for subsystem-specific handoffs.

---

### Step 6: 📖 Research Corpus (13 Reports - FOR DEEP DIVES ONLY)
?? **Location:** `claude-project/revolution-research/`

**IMPORTANT: You don't need to read all 350 pages to start working!**

**When to reference:**
- Building Layer 0-4 features
- Validating architectural decisions
- Understanding WHY a pattern was chosen
- Resolving technical questions with empirical evidence

**Quick Navigation:**
1. **File:** `RESEARCH_INDEX.md` - Overview of all 13 reports (Quick Reference Table)
2. **File:** `REVOLUTION_INTEGRATION.md` ? **MOST IMPORTANT** - Maps research to 5 Layers + 7 Critical Gaps

**The 13 Research Reports:**
1. Human-AI Collaboration Theory (LOA Framework)
2. Reinforcement Learning for Self-Improvement
3. Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns
4. Vector Memory & Context Management
5. Production AI Reliability & Monitoring
6. ADHD-Optimized Design Patterns (THE BIBLE)
7. Security in Agentic AI Systems
8. n8n Enterprise Production Patterns
9. Claude Desktop + MCP + Windows Integration
10. Git-Based Autonomous AI Operating Systems
11. Production Operations & Maintenance
12. Local LLM Optimization
13. Layer 4 Observability & Trust Calibration

**Coverage:**
- **Layer 0 (Substrate):** Research 4, 8, 10, 11
- **Layer 1 (Router):** Research 5, 11
- **Layer 2 (Assistant):** Research 9, 12
- **Layer 3 (Architect):** Research 1, 1.5, 3, 13
- **Layer 4 (Strategist):** Research 2, 13
- **Cross-Cutting:** Research 6 (ADHD), Research 7 (Security)

**How to use:**
1. Check `REVOLUTION_INTEGRATION.md` first (maps research to your current work)
2. Read specific research report sections as needed (not entire reports!)
3. Every architectural decision should reference research for 95% confidence

**DON'T:**
- Read all 13 reports upfront (cognitive overload!)
- Try to memorize everything (use as reference)
- Ignore research when making architectural decisions

**DO:**
- Reference research when user asks "why this pattern?"
- Cite research numbers when validating decisions (e.g., "Research #9 shows...")
- Use REVOLUTION_INTEGRATION.md as your navigation map

---

## After Reading - Summarize to User (Hebrew)

Before doing ANY work, tell the user in Hebrew:

```
���! ����� �� Memory Bank.

?? **���� �����:**
- Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (~32% complete)
- ������ �������: Architecture Cleanup (single metaphor established - Head/Hands/Truth/Nerves)
- ���: Fix TD-002 (Windows MCP stdout) �� Reconciler Apply (2.4c) �� Scheduled Observer (2.3b)

?? **�������� �����:**
1. Fix TD-002 - Investigate Windows MCP stdout issue (blocker for apply validation)
2. Continue Reconciler - Apply Logic (2.4c) if willing to skip validation
3. Scheduled Observer (2.3b) - n8n automation

�� ���� �����?
```

**Note:** This is updated as of 2025-12-01. Always update with actual current state from `01-active-context.md`.

---

## Critical Rules

### ? DO:
- Read these 2 files FIRST: project-brief.md + 01-active-context.md
- Summarize current state to user in Hebrew
- Wait for user to choose direction before starting work
- Follow the Chat?Spec?Change pattern
- Auto-update Memory Bank after every slice (Protocol 1)

### ? DON'T:
- Start working without reading Memory Bank
- Skip the summary step
- Read all files randomly - follow the order above
- Guess the current state - check 01-active-context.md
- Ask "should I update Memory Bank?" - just do it automatically

---

## Self-Check Before Starting Work

**Ask yourself:**
- ? Did I read project-brief.md?
- ? Did I read 01-active-context.md completely?
- ? Did I summarize to user: Phase, %, recent work, 2-3 next options?
- ? Did I wait for user to choose direction?
- ? User confirmed before I started executing?

**If any answer is NO ? STOP and complete that step first!**

- Historical context? ? Read 02-progress.md

**But don't read these until you need them!** Start with project-brief + 01-active-context.

---

## Why This Matters

**Without this context load:**
- ? You might redo work that's already done
- ? You might miss important architectural decisions
- ? You might ignore technical debt (TD-XXX)
- ? You might create drift between documentation and reality

**With this context load:**
- ? You continue smoothly from where we left off
- ? You respect the existing architecture and decisions
- ? You maintain system integrity
- ? You work efficiently with ADHD-aware workflows

**Now go read project-brief.md and 01-active-context.md!** ??
