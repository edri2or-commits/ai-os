# Idea: AI-Powered Task Prioritizer

## Raw Thought
What if I built a tool that looks at my Life Graph data (energy levels, contexts, deadlines) and suggests what task to work on right now?

Could use the YAML frontmatter from all my tasks/projects and create a smart prioritization algorithm.

## Next Step
- Process this during weekly review
- Decide: Is this a project? A resource? Or just an interesting idea to archive?

## Related
- Life Graph schema (will be defined in Slice 2.2)
- Observer pattern (Phase 2)

(To be processed into Projects/Areas/Resources/Archive during next review)
