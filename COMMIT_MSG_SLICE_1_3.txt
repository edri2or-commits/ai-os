fix(drift): Reconcile Truth Layer with git HEAD + bootstrap SERVICES_STATUS

Problem:
- Truth Layer showed last_commit: 43b308a
- Actual git HEAD: eefc5d3 (3 commits ahead)
- SERVICES_STATUS.json was empty (blocking reconciler)

Solution:
1. Ran snapshot generator → updated GOVERNANCE_LATEST.json
2. Bootstrapped SERVICES_STATUS.json as minimal placeholder
3. Ran reconciler → updated SYSTEM_STATE_COMPACT.json

Changes:
- governance/snapshots/GOVERNANCE_LATEST.json - git commit + timestamp updated
- governance/snapshots/SNAPSHOT_20251129_*.json - new snapshot created
- docs/system_state/SYSTEM_STATE_COMPACT.json - reconciled (commit, timestamp, version)
- docs/system_state/registries/SERVICES_STATUS.json - NEW: bootstrap placeholder

Notes:
- SERVICES_STATUS.json is marked as BOOTSTRAP_PLACEHOLDER
- Will be replaced by Observer-generated data in Phase 2
- Minimal structure (total: 0, services: []) - honest about current state

Research Alignment:
- Dual Truth Architecture (static → derived state flow)
- Observed State pattern (placeholder until Observer exists)
- Split-brain prevention (drift detection research)

Tools Used:
- governance/scripts/generate_snapshot.py (reads actual git)
- services/os_core_mcp/reconciler.py (propagates to derived state)

Slice: 1.3 (Fix Git HEAD drift) + Sub-Slice 1.3a (SERVICES_STATUS bootstrap)
Duration: ~35 min (including troubleshooting + SERVICES_STATUS bootstrap)
Risk: Low (reversible, honest placeholder, tested pipeline)
